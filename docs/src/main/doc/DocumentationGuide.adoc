== Applications

Overview
 {branding} is comprised of several modular applications, to be installed or uninstalled as needed.

== Applications

{branding} Administrative Application::
The administrative application enhances administrative capabilities when installing and managing {branding}. It contains various services and interfaces that allow administrators more control over their systems. 
{branding} Catalog Application::
The {branding} Catalog provides a framework for storing, searching, processing, and transforming information. 
Clients typically perform query, create, read, update, and delete (QCRUD) operations against the Catalog. 
At the core of the Catalog functionality is the *Catalog Framework*, which routes all requests and responses through the system, invoking additional processing per the system configuration.
{branding} Content Application::
The {branding} Content application provides a framework for storing, reading, processing, transforming and cataloging data. 
{branding} Platform Application:: 
The Platform application is considered to be a core application of the distribution. The Platform application has fundamental building blocks that the distribution needs to run.
These building blocks include subsets of: Karaf (http://karaf.apache.org/), CXF (http://cxf.apache.org/), Cellar (http://karaf.apache.org/index/subprojects/cellar.html), and Camel (http://camel.apache.org/). 
+
Included as part of the Platform application is also a Command Scheduler. The Command Scheduler allows users to schedule Command Line Shell Commands to run at certain specified intervals. 
{branding} Security Application::
The Security application provides authentication, authorization, and auditing services for the {branding}. They comprise both a framework that developers and integrators can extend and a reference implementation that meets security requirements. More information about the security framework and how everything works as a single security solution can be found on the Managing Web Service Security page. 
{branding} Solr Catalog Application::
The Solr Catalog Provider (SCP) is an implementation of the `CatalogProvider` interface using Apache Solr (http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) as a data store. 
{branding} Spatial Application::
The {branding} Spatial Application provides KML transformer and a KML network link endpoint that allows a user to generate a View-based KML Query Results Network Link. 
{branding} Standard Search UI::
The {branding} Standard Search UI application allows a user to search for records in the local Catalog (provider) and federated sources. Results of the search are returned in HTML format and are displayed on a globe, providing a visual representation of where the records were found.

== Choosing a Guide
The documentation is segmented by user needs, with users categorized as Users, Administrators, Integrators, and Developers. 

Users::
Users are end users interacting with the applications at the most basic level. 

Administrators::
Administrators will be installing, maintaining, and supporting existing applications.

Integrators::
Integrators will use the existing applications to support their external frameworks.

Developers::
Developers will build or extend the functionality of the applications.
