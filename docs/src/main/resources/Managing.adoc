=== Applications

{branding} is comprised of several modular applications, to be installed or uninstalled as needed.

{branding} Administrative Application::
The administrative application enhances administrative capabilities when installing and managing {branding}. It contains various services and interfaces that allow administrators more control over their systems. 
{branding} Catalog Application::
The {branding} Catalog provides a framework for storing, searching, processing, and transforming information. 
Clients typically perform query, create, read, update, and delete (QCRUD) operations against the Catalog. 
At the core of the Catalog functionality is the *Catalog Framework*, which routes all requests and responses through the system, invoking additional processing per the system configuration.
{branding} Content Application::
The {branding} Content application provides a framework for storing, reading, processing, transforming and cataloging data. 
{branding} Platform Application:: 
The Platform application is considered to be a core application of the distribution. The Platform application has fundamental building blocks that the distribution needs to run.
These building blocks include subsets of: Karaf (http://karaf.apache.org/), CXF (http://cxf.apache.org/), Cellar (http://karaf.apache.org/index/subprojects/cellar.html), and Camel (http://camel.apache.org/). 
+
Included as part of the Platform application is also a Command Scheduler. The Command Scheduler allows users to schedule Command Line Shell Commands to run at certain specified intervals. 
{branding} Security Application::
The Security application provides authentication, authorization, and auditing services for the {branding}. They comprise both a framework that developers and integrators can extend and a reference implementation that meets security requirements. More information about the security framework and how everything works as a single security solution can be found on the Managing Web Service Security page. 
{branding} Solr Catalog Application::
The Solr Catalog Provider (SCP) is an implementation of the `CatalogProvider` interface using Apache Solr (http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) as a data store. 
{branding} Spatial Application::
The {branding} Spatial Application provides KML transformer and a KML network link endpoint that allows a user to generate a View-based KML Query Results Network Link. 
{branding} Standard Search UI::
The {branding} Standard Search UI application allows a user to search for records in the local Catalog (provider) and federated sources. Results of the search are returned in HTML format and are displayed on a globe, providing a visual representation of where the records were found.

== Choosing a Guide
The documentation is segmented by user needs, with users categorized as Users, Administrators, Integrators, and Developers. 

Users::
Users are end users interacting with the applications at the most basic level. 

Administrators::
Administrators will be installing, maintaining, and supporting existing applications.

Integrators::
Integrators will use the existing applications to support their external frameworks.

Developers::
Developers will build or extend the functionality of the applications. 

== Quick Start

Distributed Data Framework ({branding}) is an agile and modular integration framework.  It is primarily focused on data integration, enabling clients to insert, query and transform information from disparate data sources via the {branding} Catalog. A Catalog API allows integrators to insert new capabilities at various stages throughout each operation.  {branding} is designed with the following architectural qualities to benefit integrators.

=== Quick Start
This quick tutorial will demonstrate:

- [*] Installation
- [*] Catalog Capabilities: Ingest and query using every endpoint
- [*] Use of the Content Framework
- [*] Metrics Reporting

==== Prerequisites
Review link:prerequisites.html[Prerequisites] to ensure all system prerequisites are met.

==== Install {branding}

. Install {branding} by unzipping the zip file. This will create an installation directory, which is typically created with the name and version of the application. This installation directory will be referred to as `<DISTRIBUTION_INSTALL_DIR>`. Substitute the actual directory name in place of this.
. Start {branding} by running the `<DISTRIBUTION_INSTALL_DIR>/bin/ddf` script (or `ddf.bat` on Windows).
. Verify the distribution is running.
. Go to https://localhost:8993/admin.
. Enter the default username of "admin" (no quotes) and the password of "admin" (no quotes).
. Follow the install instructions for more extensive install guidance, or use the command line console (which appears after the  <DISTRIBUTION_INSTALL_DIR>/bin/ddf script starts) to install a few applications as mentioned below.
+
----
app:start catalog-app
app:start content-app
app:start solr-app
----
+
[WARNING]
====
Other applications may be installed at a later time.
====
+
. Go to http://localhost:8181/services and verify five REST services are available: admin, application, metrics, catalog, and catalog/query.
. Click on the links to each REST service's WADL to see its interface.
. In the Web Console (at /system/console/configMgr), configure the system settings.
.. Enter the username of "admin" (no quotes) and the password "admin" (no quotes).
.. Select Platform Global Configuration.
.. Enter the port and host where the distribution is running.

==== Catalog Capabilities

. Create an entry in the Catalog by ingesting a valid GeoJson file (attached to this page). This ingest can be performed using:
.. A REST client, such as Google Chrome's Advanced REST Client. OR 
.. Using the following curl command to POST to the Catalog REST CRUD endpoint.
+
.Windows Example
----
curl.exe -H "Content-type: application/json;id=geojson" -i -X POST -d @"C:\path\to\geojson_valid.json" http://localhost:8181/services/catalog
----
+
.*NIX Example
----
curl -H "Content-type: application/json;id=geojson" -i -X POST -d @geojson_valid.json http://localhost:8181/services/catalog
----
+
Where: 
*-H* adds an HTTP header. In this case, Content-type header `application/json;id=geojson` is added to match the data being sent in the request.
*-i* requests that HTTP headers are displayed in the response.
*-X* specifies the type of HTTP operation. For this example, it is necessary to POST (ingest) data to the server.
*-d* specifies the data sent in the POST request. The @ character is necessary to specify that the data is a file.
+
The last parameter is the URL of the server that will receive the data.
+
This should return a response similar to the following (the actual catalog ID in the id and Location URL fields will be different):
+
.Sample Response
[source,http,linenums]
----
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Length: 0
Date: Mon, 22 Apr 2013 22:02:22 GMT
id: 44dc84da101c4f9d9f751e38d9c4d97b
Location: http://localhost:8181/services/catalog/44dc84da101c4f9d9f751e38d9c4d97b
Server: Jetty(7.5.4.v20111024)
----
+
. Verify the entry was successfully ingested by entering in a browser the URL returned in the POST response's HTTP header. For instance in our example, it was `/services/catalog/44dc84da101c4f9d9f751e38d9c4d97b`. This should display the catalog entry in XML within the browser.
. Verify the catalog entry exists by executing a query via the OpenSearch endpoint.
. Enter the following URL in a browser /services/catalog/query?q=ddf. A single result, in Atom format, should be returned.

==== Use of the Content Framework
Using the Content framework's directory monitor, ingest a file so that it is stored in the content repository with a metacard created and inserted into the Catalog.

. In the Web Console, select the Configuration tab.
. Select the *Content Directory Monitor*.
. Set the directory path to *inbox*.
. Click the *Save* button.
. Copy the attached link:geojson_valid.json[geojson] file to the `<DISTRIBUTION_INSTALL_DIR>/inbox` directory.
+
The Content Framework will:
+
.. ingest the file,
.. store it in the content repository at <DISTRIBUTION_INSTALL_DIR>/content/store/<GUID>/geojson_valid.json,
.. look up the GeoJson Input Transformer based on the mime type of the ingested file,
.. create a metacard based on the metadata parsed from the ingested GeoJson file, and
.. insert the metacard into the Catalog using the CatalogFramework.
+
Note that XML metadata for text searching is not automatically generated from GeoJson fields.
. Verify GeoJson file was stored using the Content REST endpoint.
.. Install the feature content-rest-endpoint using the Features tab in the Web Console.
.. Send a GET command to read the content from the content repository using the Content REST endpoint. This can be done using curl command below. Note that the GUID will be different for each ingest. The GUID can be determined by           going to the <DISTRIBUTION_INSTALL_DIR>/content/store directory and copying the sub-directory in this folder (there should only be one).

.*NIX Example
[source]
----
curl -X GET http://localhost:8181/services/content/c90147bf86294d46a9d35ebbd44992c5
----

The response to the GET command will be the contents of the geojson_valid.json file originally ingested.

=== Metrics Reporting

Complete the following procedure now that several queries have been executed.
. Open the Web Console (/system/console/metrics).
. Select the PNG link for Catalog Queries under the column labeled 1h (one hour). A graph of the catalog queries that were performed in the last hour is displayed.
. Select the browser's back button to return to the Metrics tab.
. Select the XLS link for Catalog Queries under the column labeled 1d (one day).

.Handy Tip
[TIP]
====
Based on the browser's configuration, the .xls file will be downloaded or automatically displayed in Excel.

== Using {branding}
include::config.adoc[]

=== Overview
Distributed Data Framework ({branding}) is an agile and modular integration framework.  It is primarily focused on data integration, enabling clients to insert, query and transform information from disparate data sources via the {branding} Catalog. A Catalog API allows integrators to insert new capabilities at various stages throughout each operation.  {branding} is designed with the following architectural qualities to benefit integrators.

=== Understanding Metadata and Metacards
Metadata is information about a resource, organized into a schema to make it possible to search against. The {branding} Catalog stores this metadata and allows access to it. If desired, the {branding} Content application can be installed to store the resources themselves. Metacards are single instances of metadata, representing a single record, in the Metadata Catalog (MDC). Metacards follow one of several schemas to ensure reliable, accurate, and complee metadata. Essentially, Metacards function as containers of metadata.

=== Populating Metacards (during ingest)
Upon ingest, a metacard transformer will read the data from the ingested file and populate the fields of the metacard. Exactly how this is accomplished depends on the origin of the data, but most fields (except id) are imported directly.

=== Searching Metadata

{branding} provides the capability to search the Metadata Catalog (MDC) for metadata. There are a number of different types of searches that can be performed on the MDC, and these searches are accessed using one of several interfaces.
This section provides are very high level overview of introductory concepts of searching with {branding}. These concepts are expanded upon in later sections.

==== Search Types
There are four basic types of metadata search. Additionally, any of the types can be combined to create a compound search.

===== Contextual Search
A contextual search is used when searching for textual information. It is similar to a Google search over the metadata contained in the MDC. Contextual searches may use wildcards, logical operators, and approximate matches. 

===== Spatial Search
A spatial search is used for Area of Interest (AOI) searches. Polygon and point radius searches are supported. Specifically, the spatial search looks at the metacards' location attribute and coordinates are specified in WGS 84 decimal degrees. 

===== Temporal Search
A temporal search finds information from a specific time range.  Two types of temporal searches are supported, relative and absolute.  Relative searches contain an offset from the current time, while absolute searches contain a start and an end timestamp. Temporal searches can look at the effective date attribute or the modified date. 

===== Datatype
A datatype search is used to search for metadata based on the datatype, and optional versions.  Wildcards (*) can be used in both the datatype and version fields.  Metadata that matches any of the datatypes (and associated versions if specified) will be returned.  If a version is not specified, then all metadata records for the specified datatype(s) regardless of version will be returned.

===== Compound Search
These search types may be combined to create Compound searches. For example, a Contextual and Spatial search could be combined into one Compound search to search for certain text in metadata in a particular region of the world.

==== Search Interfaces

===== {branding} Search UI Application
The {branding} Search UI application provides a graphic interface to return results in HTML format and locate them on an interactive globe or map. For more details on using this application, go to {branding} Search UI User's Guide.

===== SSH
Additionally, it is possible to use a client script to remotely access {branding} via SSH and send console commands to search and ingest data.

=== Catalog Search Result Objects
Data is returned from searches as Catalog Search Result objects. This is a subtype of Catalog Entry that also contains additional data based on what type of sort policy was applied to the search.
Because it is a subtype of Catalog Entry, a Catalog Search Result has all Catalog Entry’s fields such as metadata, effective time, and modified time. It also contains some of the following fields, depending on type of search, that are populated by {branding} when the search occurs:

* Distance: Populated when a point radius spatial search occurs. Numerical value that indicates the result’s distance from the center point of the search.
* Units: Populated when a point radius spatial search occurs. Indicates the units (kilometer, mile, etc.) for the distance field.
* Relevance: Populated when a contextual search occurs. Numerical value that indicates how relevant the text in the result is to the text originally searched for.

==== Search Programmatic Flow
Searching the catalog involves three basic steps:

. Define the search criteria (contextual, spatial, temporal, or compound – a combination of two or more types of searches).
.. Optionally define a sort policy and assign it to the criteria.
.. For contextual search, optionally set the `fuzzy` flag to `true` or `false` (the default value for the `Metadata Catalog` `fuzzy` flag is `true`, while the `portal` default value is `false`).
.. For contextual search, optionally set the caseSensitive flag to true (the default is that caseSensitive flag is NOT set and queries are not case sensitive). Doing so enables case sensitive matching on the search criteria. For example, if caseSensitive is set to true and the phrase is “Baghdad” then only metadata containing “Baghdad” with the same matching case will be returned. Words such as “baghdad”, “BAGHDAD”,  and “baghDad” will not be returned because they do not match the exact case of the search term.
. Issue a search
. Examine the results

These steps are performed in the same basic order but using different classes depending on whether the Web services or Search UI interfaces are used.

===== Sort Policies
Searches can also be sorted according to various built-in policies. A sort policy is applied to the search criteria after its creation but before the search is issued. The policy specifies to the {branding} the order the MDC search results should be in when they are returned to the requesting client. Only one sort policy may be defined per search.
There are three policies available.

[cols="4" options="header"]
|===

|Sort Policy
|Sorts By
|Default Order
|Available for

|Temporal   
|The catalog search result’s effective time field  
|Newest to oldest 
|All Search Types

|Distance   
|The catalog search result’s distance field  
|Nearest to farthest 
|Point-Radius Spatial searches

|Relevance  
|The catalog search result’s relevance field 
|Most to least relevant 
|Contextual

|===

If no sort policy is defined for a particular search, the temporal policy will automatically be applied.

[WARNING]
====
For Compound searches, the parent Compound search’s sort policy is used.
For example, if a Spatial search and Contextual search are the components of a Compound search, the Spatial search might have a distance policy and the Contextual search might have a relevance policy. The parent Compound search, though, does not use the policy of its child objects to define its sorting approach. The Compound search itself has its own temporal sort policy field that it will use to order the results of the search.

====

.{branding} Installation Types
[NOTE]
====
{branding} can be installed using a single distribution zip file that contains all of the {branding} applications already installed,
OR
A custom {branding} installation can be performed by using the {branding} kernel distribution zip file then hot deploying the desired {branding} apps into the running {branding} kernel's <INSTALL_DIRECTORY>/deploy directory.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Although {branding} can be installed by any user, it is recommended for security reasons to have a non-root user execute the {branding} installation.
====

=== Use the {branding} Distribution Zip to Install
* After the prerequisites have been met, as a root user if for *NIX, change the current directory to the desired install location. This will be referred to as <INSTALL_DIRECTORY>.

.*NIX Tip
[TIP]
It is recommended that the root user create a new install directory that can be owned by a non-root user (e.g., ddf-user). The non-root user (e.g., ddf-user) can now be used for the remaining installation instructions.

.Example: Create a Directory and Switch User on *NIX
----
mkdir new_installation
chown ddf-user:ddf-group new_installation
 
su - ddf-user
----

* Change the current directory to location of zip file (ddf-X.Y.zip).

.Example: Where the Zip File may be Located in *NIX
----
cd /home/user/cdrom
----

.Windows (Example assumes {branding} has been downloaded to the D drive)
----
cd D:\
----
* Copy ddf-X.Y.zip to <INSTALL_DIRECTORY>.

.*NIX
----
cp ddf-X.Y.zip <INSTALL_DIRECTORY>
----

.Windows
----
copy ddf-X.Y.zip <INSTALL_DIRECTORY>
----

* Change the current directory to the desired install location.

----

.{branding} Application Installation Dependencies
[WARNING]
====
Please read the installation instructions carefully for each {branding} application because some of the applications depend on other {branding} applications having been previously installed.

The order the {branding} applications are listed below is the recommended order of installation. Each application must be active before installing the next application is installed. The app:list console command can be used to verify the state of each app as it is installed.
====

* Install the Platform application by following the Platform Application Installation instructions.
* Install any optional applications that may be needed for the desired configuration.
** Catalog Application Installation instructions
** Security Application Installation instructions
** Content Application Installation instructions
** Spatial Application Installation instructions
** Solr Catalog Application Installation instructions are included in each of the Solr Catalog configurations. Refer to the appropriate section for the desired Solr Catalog Provider configuration's installation instructions.
*** Embedded Solr Catalog Provider
*** External Solr Catalog Provider
*** Standalone Solr Server
* Proceed to Configuration.

==== (Option 2/Part 2) Configuration
. Open a compatible web browser and log in to the Administrator Console (http://localhost:8181/system/console) with username "admin" and password "admin" (no quotes).  
. Select the Configuration tab in the Administrator Console.
.. Select Platform Global Configuration.  
... In the Host field, enter the IP address or hostname of the installation.  
... In the Port field, enter 8181. The port can be changed later, if necessary.
... Enter the site name (e.g., the name {branding} will return in federation and web service responses).
... Select the Save button.
.. Select Catalog Sorted Federation Strategy.  
... In the Maximum start index field, enter the maximum query offset number or keep the default setting. Refer to Standard Catalog Framework for additional information.
... Select the Save button.

==== Verification
At this point, {branding} should be configured and running with a Solr Catalog Provider. New features (endpoints, services, and sites) can be added as needed.

Verification is achieved by checking that all of the {branding} bundles are in an Active state (excluding fragment bundles which remain in a Resolved state).

The following command displays the status of all the {branding} bundles:

.View Status
----
ddf@local>list | grep -i ddf
----
[WARNING]
====
If displayed, the *{branding} :: Distribution :: Web Console* entry should be in the *Resolved* state. This is expected. The {branding} Distribution Web Console is an OSGi bundle fragment. Bundle fragments are distinguished from other bundles in the command line console list by a new line under the its bundle status that states `Hosts`, followed by a bundle number. Bundle fragments remain in the *Resolved* state and can never move to the *Active* state.
====

.Example: Bundle Fragment in the Command Line Console

== Configuring
{branding} can be configured in several ways, depending on need.

=== Configuring via the Admin Console

==== Accessing the Admin Console
Open the admin portal.
* http://localhost:8181/admin
* Enter Username and Password.
[NOTE]
====
The default username/password in admin/admin. To change this, refer to Password Management page.
====

==== Initial Configuration
The first time the {branding} administrator portal runs, the initial configuration steps appear. Click Start to begin.

image::start.png[Start]

On the next screen, general configuration settings such as host address, port and site name can all be configured.

image::general_configuration_settings.png[General Configuration Settings]

Next, choose between a standard installation and a full installation. Individual applications can be added, removed or deactivated later

image::setup_types.png[Setup Types]

The final step of initial configuration is a display of all applications installed and their current status. This tree structure demonstrates how several applications depend on other applications.

image::select_applications_to_setup.png[Select Applications]

[WARNING]
====
Platform App, Admin App, and Security Services App CANNOT be selected or unselected as it is installed by default and can cause errors if removed.
**Security Services App appears to be unselected upon first view of the tree structure, but it is in fact automatically installed with a later part of the installation process.
====

==== Viewing Currently Active Applications

===== Tile View
The first view presented is the Tile View, displaying all active applications as individual tiles.

image::tile_view.png[Tile View]

===== List View
Optionally, active applications can be displayed in a list format by clicking the list view button.

image::list_view.png[List View]

Either view has an > arrow to view more information about the application as currently configured.

===== Configuration
The Configuration tab lists all bundles associated with the application as links to configure any configurable properties of that bundle.

image::configuration_tab.png[Configuration Tab]

===== Details
The Details tab gives a description, version, status, and list of other applications that either required for , or rely on, the current application.

image::details_tab.png[Details Tab]

===== Features
The features tab breaks down the individual features of the application that can be installed or uninstalled as configurable features.

image::features_tab.png[Features Tab]

==== Managing Applications
The Manage button enables activation/deactivation and adding/removing applications. 

image::managing_applications.png[Manage]

===== Activating / Deactivating Applications
The Deactivate button stops individual applications and any dependent apps. Certain applications are central to overall functionality and cannot be deactivated. These will have the Deactivate button disabled. Disabled apps will be moved to a list at the bottom of the page, with an enable button to reactivate, if desired.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Deactivating the platform-app, admin-app, and security-services-app will cause errors within the system, so the capabilities to do so have been DISABLED.
====

===== Adding Applications
The Add Application button is at the end of the list of currently active applications. 

===== Removing Applications
To remove an application, it must first be deactivated. This enables the Remove Application button. 

===== Upgrading Applications

Each application tile includes an upgrade but to select a new version to install.

==== System Settings Tab
The configuration and features installed can be viewed and edited from the System tab as well, however, it is recommended that configuration be managed from the applications tab.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In general, applications should be managed via the applications tab. 
Configuration via this page could result in an unstable system. 
Proceed with caution!

==== Manage Features
{branding} includes many components, packaged as features, that can be installed and/or uninstalled without restarting the system. Features are collections of OSGi bundles, configuration data, and/or other features. For more information on the features that come with {branding}, including a list of the ones included, consult the {branding} Included Features page in the Software Version Description Document (SVDD).

.Transitive Dependencies
[NOTE]
====
Features may have dependencies on other features and will auto-install them as needed.
====

===== Install Features Using the Web Console
. Open the web administration console.
.. `http://localhost:8181/system/console`
.. Enter Username and Password
. Select the Features tab. +
image:toolbar.png[Toolbar]
. Select the play arrow under the Actions column for the feature that should be installed.
. Wait for the *Status* to change from *Uninstalled* to *Installed*.
. Optional: Check the bundle status.
.. Select the Bundles tab.
.. Scroll down to the associated bundles and verify they were installed with a status of Active.

===== Uninstall Features
. Open the web administration console.
.. `http://localhost:8181/system/console`
.. Enter Username and Password
. Select the Features tab. +
image:toolbar.png[Toolbar]
. Select the eject icon under the Actions column for the feature that should be uninstalled.
. Wait for the *Status* to change from *Installed* to *Uninstalled*.
. Optional: Check the bundle status.
.. Select the Bundles tab.
.. Verify the absence of the associated bundle(s).

===== Add Feature Repositories
. Open the web administration console.
.. `http://localhost:8181/system/console`
.. Enter Username and Password
. Select the Features tab.
. Enter the URL of the feature repository (see below) to be added.
. Select the *Add URL* button.
. The new feature repository is added to the list of *Feature Repositories* above the URL field.

There are several ways a new feature repository can be discovered based on the URL entered:

* The URL can contain the fully qualified path to the feature repository, e.g., mvn:https://tools.codice.org/artifacts/content/groups/public/ddf-standard/2.2.0/xml/features. This URL can include the username and password credentials if necessary. e.g., mvn:https://user/password@tools.codice.org/artifacts/content/groups/public/ddf-standard/2.2.0/xml/features. Note that the password will be in clear text.
* The URL can only be the mvn URL, e.g., `mvn:ddf.features/ddf-standard/2.2/xml/features ddf-standard/2.2.0/xml/features`. The feature repositories configured for {branding} will be searched.

Repositories to be searched by {branding} can be configured in one of several ways:

* Set the org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.repositories property in the `<DDF_INSTALL_DIR>/etc/org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.cfg` file (most common).
* Set the org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.settings property in the `<DDF_INSTALL_DIR>/etc/org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.cfg` file to the maven `settings.xml` file that specifies the repository(ies) to be searched. A `settings.xml` template file for this configuration is provided in `<DDF_INSTALL_DIR>/etc/templates/settings.xml`
* Create a maven `settings.xml` file in the `<USER_HOME_DIR>/.m2` directory of the user running DDF that specifies the repository(ies) to be searched (this method is typical for a developer).
* The simplest approach is to specify the fully qualified URL to the feature repository.

==== Known Issues

===== Blank Web Console
{branding} uses Pax Web as part of its HTTP support. Modifying the Pax Web runtime configuration in the web console may cause the web console to freeze.

===== Solution
Use the configuration instructions according to the hardening instructions.

=== Configuring a Java Keystore for Secure Communications

[NOTE]
====
The following information was sourced from https://www.racf.bnl.gov/terapaths/software/the-terapaths-api/example-java-client/java-client/setting-up-keystores-with-jetty-and-keytool.
====

==== Create a Client Keystore
The following steps define the procedure for using a PKCS12 certificate. This is the most popular format that is used when exporting from a web browser.

. Obtain a personal ECA cert (client certificate).
.. Open *Internet Explorer → Tools → Options*.
.. Select the Content tab.
.. Select *Certificates*.
.. Select the Personal tab.
.. Select the certificate to be exported. Choose the certificate without a "Friendly Name" and is not the "Encryption Cert".
.. Select the *Export* button.
.. Follow the steps in the Certificate Export Wizard.
.. When a prompt requests to export the private key, select the Yes button.
. Download a jetty 6.1.5 distribution from http://dist.codehaus.org/jetty/jetty-6.1.5/jetty-6.1.5.zip.
. Unpack the jetty distribution and place the client certificate (the one just exported) in the lib directory.
. Navigate to the lib directory of the jetty distribution in a command console.
. Add a cert to a new Java keystore, replacing cert with the name of the PKCS12 keystore to be converted.
. Replace `clientKeystore` with the desired name of the Java keystore: +
`java -cp jetty-6.1.5.jar org.mortbay.jetty.security.PKCS12Import cert.p12 clientKeystore.jks`
. Enter the two passwords when prompted. 
.. Input keystore passphrase is the passphrase that is used to protect cert.p12.
.. Output keystore passphrase is the passphrase that is set for the new Java keystore clientKeystore.jks.
. It is recommended to set the private key password to the same as the keystore password due to limitations in Java. 
. Run the following command to determine the alias name of the added current entry. It is listed after Alias Name: +
`keytool -list -v -keystore clientKeystore.jks`
. Clone the existing key using the java keytool executable, filling in `<CurrentAlias>`, `<NewAlias>`, `clientKeystore.jks`, and `password` with the correct names. +
`keytool -keyclone -alias "<CurrentAlias>" -dest "<NewAlias>" -keystore clientKeystore.jks -storepass password`
. When prompted for a password, use the same password used when the keystore was created.
. Delete the original alias. +
`keytool -delete -alias "<CurrentAlias>" -keystore clientKeystore.jks -storepass password`

[NOTE]
====
After the keystore is successfully created, delete the jetty files used to perform the import.
====

==== Create a Truststore
.Import the certificate into a Java keystore as a trusted ca certificate. +
`keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias "Trusted Cert" -file trustcert.cer -keystore truststore.jks`
. Enter in a keystore password when prompted.

==== Add a Certificate to an Existing Keystore

. Import the certificate into a Java keystore as a certificate. +
`keytool -importcert -file newcert.cer -keystore clientKeystore.jks -alias "New Alias"`
. Enter in the keystore password, if prompted.

=== Configuring Solr Catalog Provider

==== Configure the Solr Catalog Provider Data Directory
The Solr Catalog Provider writes index files to the file system. By default, these files are stored under `$DDF_HOME/data/solr/catalog/data`.  If there is inadequate space in `$DDF_HOME`, or if it is desired to maintain backups of the indexes only, this directory can be changed.

In order to change the Data Directory, the `system.properties` file in `$DDF_HOME/etc` must be edited prior to starting {branding}.

.Edit the system.properties file
[source,bash,linenums]
----
# Uncomment the following line and set it to the desired path
#solr.catalog.data.dir=/opt/solr/catalog/data
----

==== Changing the Data Directory after {branding} has ingested data

. Shut down {branding}.
. Create the new directory to hold the indexes.
+
.Make new Data Directory
[source,bash]
----
mkdir /path/to/new/data/dir
----
+
. Copy the indexes to the new directory.
+
.Copy the indexes to the new Directory.
[source,bash]
----
cp /path/to/old/data/dir/* /path/to/new/data/dir/.
----
+
. Set the system.properties file to use the new directory.
+
.Set the SOLR_CATALOG_DATA_DIR
[source,bash]
----
solr.catalog.data.dir=/path/to/new/data/dir
----
+
. Restart {branding}.

=== Configuring {branding} Application and Configuration Clustering

An essential part to the {branding} Clustering solution is the ability to manage applications and configurations among cluster nodes. The following documentation will help in setting up a set of {branding} server nodes in a cluster, and allow an administrator to manage the applications and configurations that are deployed.

==== Set Up {branding} Cluster

===== Initial Setup

The goal of the {branding} Cluster solution is to keep applications and configurations synchronized on every {branding} server. When setting up a {branding} server, it is recommended that only one server is setup per machine (virtual or non-virtual). This means that for each physical machine or virtual machine (VM) that is setup, only one instance of the {branding} is deployed on it. This configuration provides the least complexity in configuration of the {branding} Cluster and allows the {branding} server itself to utilize the resources of the entire system. It is also recommended that all {branding} servers and systems be configured the same. This means that all {branding} server platforms have the same configurations and applications running initially. Also, ensure that all physical and virtual systems running the {branding} servers have the same configuration (e.g., operating system, memory, CPU, etc.).

===== Start and Configure New {branding} Server Node Clusters
Before starting your {branding} cluster nodes, you must first setup your node network configurations. See the Configuring {branding} Clustering For Multicast & Unicast section for more information. To view all of the available nodes, navigate in your browser to the {branding} Web Console (http://localhost:8181/system/console) and click on the tab labeled “Clustered Groups”. Under the group “default”, you should see all running {branding} nodes that have been clustered. It is also possible to move all instances into a named group. In order to perform this action, you must have access to one of the {branding} command line shells directly or utilize Gogo located at http://localhost:8181/system/console/gogo.

[source,bash]
----
features:install cellar
----
The first action that will be performed is the creation of a new group. To create a new cluster group named “mygroup”, execute the following command:

[source,bash]
----
cluster:group-create mygroup
----
This command will create a new cluster group which will not contain any nodes. Execute the following command to view all groups:

[source,bash]
----
cluster:group-list
----
You should see the following output:

[source,bash]
----
Group Members
* [default ] [192.168.1.110:5701* ]
[mygroup ] []
----
As you can see, there are now two groups, the default group and the new group that you have just created. We now need to move the {branding} node out of the “default” group and into “mygroup”. Execute the following commands:
[source,bash]
----
cluster:group-join mygroup 192.168.1.110:5701
 
cluster:group-quit default 192.168.1.110:5701
----
The first command allows the {branding} node to join the new group. The second command removes the {branding} node from the “default” group.

[source,bash]
----
Group Members
[default ] []
* [mygroup ] [192.168.1.110:5701* ]
----
These commands should be executed on all “production” nodes located in the default group. Note: The default group will always remain and cannot be deleted. It is possible for {branding} nodes to be separated into multiple groups. It is also possible for one {branding} node to exist in multiple groups. These are advanced topics and can be addressed in additional documentation links.

===== Add a {branding} Server Node to the Cluster
There may be a need for an additional {branding} server node after an existing {branding} cluster has already been configured and deployed. It is important that when adding additional nodes, the new node must match the existing nodes in terms of applications and configurations. Therefore it is good practice to copy one of the existing nodes and push that copy to a new virtual machine or server machine instance. This will provide a stabler transition of the new node into the cluster. Once you have setup the new node, you can follow the instructions above to add the new node into the cluster group, if needed.

==== Manage Applications
Application management within the cluster has been designed to function as if you were only managing one instance of {branding}. All {branding} applications are handled at the feature level. Therefore, the Features section of the Web Console can be used to manage all applications within the {branding} Cluster. The Features section of the Web Console can be accessed by navigating to http://localhost:8181/system/console/features/features in a web browser. Credentials may be required (username and password) to access the console.

From the Features console, the following functions are available:

* Provides a listing of the available features and repositories in the cluster
* Add new repositories to the cluster
* Remove existing repositories from the cluster
* Install features from repositories into the cluster
* Uninstall or remove features from the cluster

For more information on using the console, refer to the {branding} User documentation.

Just as with Application Management, managing configurations within a cluster was designed to function as if you were configuring one instance of {branding}. There are two areas where {branding} configurations can be modified. Most modifications will occur within the Configurations section of the Web Console. The Web Console can be accessed by navigating to http://localhost:8181/system/console in a web browser. Credentials may be required (username and password) to access the console.

From the Configuration console, the following features are available:

* Provides a listing of the available configurations
* Edit configuration values in the cluster
* Unbind the configuration from the bundle
* Remove the configuration from the cluster

For more information on using the console, refer to the {branding} User's Guide.

===== Control Feature and Configuration Synchronization 

There may be instances where certain configurations are to remain local to a certain {branding} node. This behavior can be controlled through the cellar groups configuration. To open this configuration, navigate to Within the configuration list, search for the configuration with name “org.apache.karaf.cellar.groups”. Click on the configuration to view / edit. Within the file you will see many configurations listed with the following format:

[source,bash]
----
[cluster group name] . [configuration type (e.g. feature, configuration, etc.)]. [list type] = [values]
----

These configurations allow you to control the synchronization of features and configurations through blacklists and whitelists. If you do not want a specific feature or configuration to propagate throughout your cluster group, you can put it into a blacklist. By default for all cluster groups, all features are in the white list:

[source,bash]
----
mygroup.features.whitelist.outbound = *
----
with the exception of “`cellar`”:

[source,bash]
----
mygroup.features.blacklist.outbound = cellar
----

As for configurations, by default all configurations are whitelisted with the exception of the following:

[source,bash]
----
mygroup.config.blacklist.outbound = org.apache.felix.fileinstall*, org.apache.karaf.cellar.groups, org.apache.karaf.cellar.node, org.apache.karaf.management, org.apache.karaf.shell, org.ops4j.pax.logging
----
Once you have made your changes, you can save the configuration by pressing the “Save” button.

==== Additional Details

===== Configure {branding} Clustering for Unicast and Multicast
By default, {branding} clustering utilizes TCP-IP unicast for discoverying other {branding} nodes. The hazelcast.xml file located under <{branding} root>/etc/ contains the port and address configurations for network setup. The TCP-IP unicast mode has been setup to allow for manual configuration and control of initial clustering. This configuration is also beneficial for cases where a particular network cannot support multicast or multicast has been turned off for certain reasons. There is a configuration which allows auto-discovery of {branding} nodes and utilizes multicast as a transport. The hazelcast.xml file is configured like the following to allow for TCP-IP unicast discovery of cluster nodes:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<join>
	<multicast enabled="false">
		<multicast-group>224.2.2.3</multicast-group>
		<multicast-port>54327</multicast-port>
	</multicast>
	<tcp-ip enabled="true">
		<interface>127.0.0.1</interface>
	</tcp-ip>
	<aws enabled="false">
		<access-key>my-access-key</access-key>
		<secret-key>my-secret-key</secret-key>
		<region>us-east-1</region>
	</aws>
</join>
----

As you can see, the multicast option has been set to false and the tcp-ip option is set to true. All systems that will participate in the cluster need to have their ip addresses listed within the interface section highlighted. These modifications must be made for each node. Once these modifications have been made to the hazelcast.xml file, it is recommended that the nodes be restarted.
The following hazelcast.xml configuration would be used for multicast auto-discovery:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<join>
	<multicast enabled="true">
		<multicast-group>224.2.2.3</multicast-group>
		<multicast-port>54327</multicast-port>
	</multicast>
	<tcp-ip enabled="false">
		<interface>127.0.0.1</interface>
	</tcp-ip>
	<aws enabled="false">
		<access-key>my-access-key</access-key>
		<secret-key>my-secret-key</secret-key>
		<region>us-east-1</region>
	</aws>
</join>
----

As you can see, the multicast option has been set to true and the tcp-ip option is set to false. A multicast group and port can be specified in the file as highlighted above. These modifications must be made for each node. Once these modifications have been made to the hazelcast.xml file, it is recommended that the nodes be restarted.

===== Verify Synchronized {branding} Nodes

In most cases, the {branding} system console should provide you with a listing of all features, repositories, and configurations that are installed on the cluster. There are times when the cluster can become out of sync. This instance may occur if a system has been offline for some time. One way to verify the synchronized lists of the cluster is to run cluster commands from the command line. In order to perform these actions, you must have access to one of the {branding} command line shells directly or through the use of Gogo (http://localhost:8181/system/console/gogo). Once at the command line, execute the following command to see the list of deployed features for your cluster:

[source,bash]
----
cluster:feature-list mygroup
----

This command will list the available features for your cluster group “mygroup”.

[source,bash]
----
Features for cluster group mygroup
Status Version Name
[installed ] [2.2.0 ] catalog-opensearch-endpoint
......
----
To view the cluster group's configurations, execute the following command:

[source,bash]
----
cluster:config-list mygroup
----
This command will show all shared configurations among the cluster group “mygroup”.

[source,bash]
----
----------------------------------------------------------------
Pid: org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn
Properties:
org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.useFallbackRepositories = false
service.pid = org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn
org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.disableAether = true
----------------------------------------------------------------
Pid: org.apache.karaf.webconsole
Properties: ....
----

The following command will list all repositories associated with the cluster group “mygroup”:

[source,bash]
----
cluster:features-url-list mygroup
The following will be displayed:
mvn:org.apache.cxf.karaf/apache-cxf/2.7.2/xml/features
mvn:org.apache.activemq/activemq-karaf/5.6.0/xml/features
mvn:ddf.catalog.kml/catalog-kml-app/2.1.0/xml/features
mvn:ddf.mime.tika/mime-tika-app/1.0.0/xml/features
----
If for any reason, any of the lists above do not match the list of features, repositories, or configurations found in the {branding} system consoles, the following command can be executed:

[source,bash]
----
cluster:sync
----

This command should allow for a {branding} node to be synchronized with the rest of the cluster.

==== Check for Active Nodes

Checking whether a node is active or not can be done utilizing the node ping command. In order to use this command you must have access to one of the the {branding} command line shells. A list of nodes can be shown by executing the following command:

[source,bash]
----
cluster:node-list
----
The command should show the following output:

[source,bash]
----
ID Host Name Port
* [192.168.1.110:5701 ] [192.168.1.110 ] [ 5701]
----

The output will show the ID, host name, and port of each active {branding} node in the cluster. The asterisk shows which node you are currently accessing the shell on. Now that you have a listing of node IDs, you can use these to ping other nodes. Execute the following command:

[source,bash]
----
cluster:node-ping
----

The following result will print out until you press ctrl-c:
[source,bash]
----
PING 192.168.1.110:5701
from 1: req=192.168.1.110:5701 time=9 ms
from 2: req=192.168.1.110:5701 time=4 ms
from 3: req=192.168.1.110:5701 time=2 ms
from 4: req=192.168.1.110:5701 time=3 ms
from 5: req=192.168.1.110:5701 time=4 ms
from 6: req=192.168.1.110:5701 time=2 ms
from 7: req=192.168.1.110:5701 time=2 ms
^C
----

The output will provide you with a typical ping result showing connectivity and response times.

=== Configuring Catalog Provider
This scenario describes how to reconfigure {branding} to use a different catalog provider.
This scenario assumes {branding} is already running.

.Use of the Dummy Catalog Provider
[NOTE]
====
This scenario uses the Dummy Catalog Provider as the catalog provider {branding} is being reconfigured to use. This is because the Dummy Catalog Provider is the only other catalog provider shipped with {branding} out of the box. The Dummy Catalog Provider should never be used in a production environment. It is only used for testing purposes.
====

==== Reconfigure

. Uninstall a Catalog Provider (if installed) by completing the procedure in the Uninstalling Features section.
. Install the new Catalog Provider, which will be the , by installing its feature ddf-provider-dummy by completing the instructions in the Installing Features section.
. Verify {branding} is running with the Dummy Provider as its Catalog Provider.
.. Select the Services tab in the Web Console. 
.. Locate the column labeled Bundle on the right. If {branding} is running with the Dummy Provider, there is an entry labeled ddf.providers.provider-dummy, as shown below.

.New catalog provider Dummy Provider installed

[source,bash]
----

=== Configuring Notifications

Notifications are messages that are sent to clients to inform them of some significant event happening in {branding}.  Clients must subscribe to a {branding} notification channel to receive these messages.

==== Usage
{branding} notifications are currently being utilized in the {branding} Catalog application for resource retrieval.  When a user initiates a resource retrieval via the {branding} Standard UI, {branding} opens the channel `/ddf/notification/catalog/downloads`, where notifications indicating the progress of that resource download are sent.  Any client interested in receiving these progress notifications must subscribe to that channel.  When {branding} starts downloading the resource to the client that requested it, a notification with a status of "Started" will be broadcast.  If the resource download fails, a notification with a status of "Failed" will be broadcast.  Or, if the resource download is being attempted again after a failure, "Retry" will be broadcast. 

When a notification is received, {branding} Standard UI displays a popup containing the contents of the notification, so a user is made aware of how their downloads are proceeding.  

Behind the scenes, the {branding} Standard UI invokes the REST endpoint to retrieve a resource.  In this request, it adds the query parameter "user" with the CometD session ID or the unique User ID as the value.  This allows the CometD server to know which subscriber is interested in the notification.  For example,  http://{branding}_HOST:8181/services/catalog/sources/dib.distribution/2f5db9e5131444279a1293c541c106cd?transform=resource&user=1w1qlo79j6tscii19jszwp9s2i55 notifications contain the following information:

[cols="1,4,1" options="header"]
|===

|Parameter Name
|Description
|Required by {branding} Standard UI

|application	
|"Downloads" for resource retrieval.  This is used as a "type" or category of messages.
|Yes

|title	
|Resource/file name for resource retrieval.	
|Yes

|message	
|Human-readable message containing status and a more detailed message.	
|Yes

|timestamp	
|Timestamp in milliseconds of when event occurs.	
|Yes

|user	
|CometD Session ID or unique User ID.	
|Yes

|status	
|Status of event.	
|No

|option	
|Resource retrieval option.	
|No

|bytes	
|Number of bytes transmitted.	
|No

|===

==== Receive Notifications

* If interested in retrieve resource notifications, a client must subscribe to the CometD `channel/ddf/notification/catalog/downloads`.   
* If interested in all notification types, a client must subscribe to the CometD `channel/ddf/notification/**`
* A client will only receive notifications for resources they have requested.  
* {branding} Standard UI is subscribed to all notifications of interest to that `user/browser session: /ddf/notification/**`
* See the Usage section for the data that a notification contains.

==== Publish Notifications
Any application running in {branding} can publish notifications that can be viewed by the {branding} Standard UI or received by another notifications client.  
. Set a properties map containing entries for each of the parameters listed above in the Usage section.
+
. Set the OSGi event topic to `ddf/notification/<application-name>/<notification-type>`.  Notice that there is no preceding slash on an OSGi event topic name, while there is one on the CometD channel name. The OSGi event topic corresponds to the CometD channel this is published on.
+
. Post the notification to the OSGi event defined in the previous step.

.Example for Publishing Notification
[source,java,linenums]
----
Dictionary <String, Object> properties = new Hashtable<String, Object>();
properties.put("application", "Downloads");
properties.put("title", resourceResponse.getResource().getName());
Long sysTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();
properties.put("message", generateMessage(status, resourceResponse.getResource().getName(), bytes, sysTimeMillis, detail));
properties.put("user", getProperty(resourceResponse, USER));
properties.put("status", "Completed");
properties.put("bytes", 1024);
properties.put("timestamp", sysTimeMillis);
 
Event event = new Event("ddf/notification/catalog/downloads", properties);
 
eventAdmin.postEvent(event);

== Managing Web Service Security

The Web Service Security (WSS) functionality that comes with {branding} is integrated throughout the system. This page acts as a central point to show how all of the pieces work together and point out where they live inside of the system. 

{branding} comes with a Security Framework and Security Services. The Security Framework is the set of APIs that define the integration with the {branding} framework and the Security Services are the reference implementations of those APIs built for a realistic end-to-end use case.

=== Security Framework
The {branding} Security Framework utilizes Apache Shiro (http://shiro.apache.org/) as the underlying security framework. The classes mentioned in this section will have their full package name listed, so it is easy to tell which classes come with the core Shiro framework and which are added by {branding}. 

==== Subject

`ddf.security.Subject <extends> org.apache.shiro.subject.Subject`

The Subject is the key object in the security framework. Most of the workflow and implementations revolve around creating and using a Subject. The Subject object in {branding} is a class that encapsulates all information about the user performing the current operation. The Subject can also be used to perform permission checks to see if the calling user has acceptable permission to perform a certain action (e.g., calling a service or returning a metacard). This class was made {branding}-specific because the Shiro interface cannot be added to the Query Request property map.

===== Implementations of Subject:

[cols="2" options="header"]
|===

|Classname
|Description

|ddf.security.impl.SubjectImpl	
|Extends org.apache.shiro.subject.support.DelegatingSubject

|===

==== Security Manager 

`ddf.security.service.SecurityManager`

The Security Manager is a service that handles the creation of Subject objects. A proxy to this service should be obtained by an endpoint to create a Subject and add it to the outgoing QueryRequest. The Shiro framework relies on creating the subject by obtaining it from the current thread. Due to the multi-threaded and stateless nature of the {branding} framework, utilizing the Security Manager interface makes retrieving Subjects easier and safer.

===== Implementations of Security Managers:
[cols="2" options="header"]
|===

|Classname
|Description

|ddf.security.service.SecurityManagerImpl	
|This implementation of the Security Manager handles taking in both `org.apache.shiro.authc`. AuthenticationToken and `org.apache.cxf.ws.security.tokenstore.SecurityToken` objects.

|===

==== Authentication Tokens
`org.apache.shiro.authc.AuthenticationToken`

Authentication Tokens are used to verify authentication of a user when creating a subject. A common use-case is when a user is logging directly in to the {branding} framework.

[cols="2" options="header"]
|===

|Classname
|Description

|ddf.security.service.impl.cas.CasAuthenticationToken	
|This Authentication Token is used for authenticating a user that has logged in with CAS. It takes in a proxy ticket which can be validated on the CAS server.

|===

==== Realms

===== Authenticating Realms
`org.apache.shiro.realm.AuthenticatingRealm`
Authenticating Realms are used to authenticate an incoming authentication token and create a Subject on successfully authentication.

====== Implementations of Authenticating Realms that come with {branding}: 

[cols="2" options="header"]
|===

|Classname
|Description

|ddf.security.realm.sts.StsRealm	
|This realm delegates authentication to the STS. It creates a RequestSecurityToken message from the incoming Authentication Token and converts a successful STS response into a Subject.

|===

===== Authorizing Realms
`org.apache.shiro.realm.AuthorizingRealm`

Authorizing Realms are used to perform authorization on the current Subject. These are used when performing both Service AuthZ and Filtering/Redaction. They are passed in the AuthorizationInfo of the Subject along with the Permissions of the object wanting to be accessed. The response from these realms is a true (if the Subject has permission to access) or false (if the Subject does not).

====== Implementations of Authorizing Realms that come with {branding}:
|===

|Classname
|Description

|ddf.security.service.AbstractAuthorizingRealm
|This is an Abstract Authorizing Realm that takes care of caching and parsing the Subject's AuthorizingInfo and should be extended to allow the implementing realm focus on making the decision.

|ddf.security.pep.realm.XACMLRealm	
|This realm delegates the authorization decision to a XACML-based Policy Decision Point (PDP) backend. It creates a XACML 3.0 request and looks on the OSGi framework for any service implementing ddf.security.pdp.api.PolicyDecisionPoint.

|ddf.security.pdp.realm.SimpleAuthZRealm	
|This realm performs the authorization decision without delegating to an external service. It uses the incoming permissions to create a decision.

=== CAS SSO Configuration

The Web Service Security (WSS) Implementation that comes with {branding} was built to run independent of an SSO or authentication mechanism. Testing out the security functionality of {branding} was performed by using the Central Authentication Server (CAS) software. This is a popular SSO appliance and allowed {branding} to be tested using realistic use cases. This page contains configurations and settings that were used to help enable CAS to work within the {branding} environment.

==== General Server Setup and Configuration

[NOTE]
====
The following procedure defines the steps for installing CAS to a Tomcat 7.x server running in Linux and Windows. Newer versions of tomcat (8.x) are incompatible with the included server.xml file and will need additional changes.
====

===== Install using {branding} CAS WAR
{branding} comes with a custom distribution of the CAS Web application that comes with LDAP and X.509 support configured and built-in. Using this configuration may save time and make setup easier.

[NOTE]
====
The CAS Web Application can be downloaded from Nexus. To find the latest version, execute a search for "cas-distribution". Link to the first release: http://artifacts.codice.org/content/repositories/releases/org/codice/cas/distribution/cas-distribution/1.0.0/cas-distribution-1.0.0.war
====

. Download and unzip Tomcat Distribution [http://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi].  The installation location is referred to as `<TOMCAT_INSTALLATION_DIR>`.
+
----
$ unzip apache-tomcat-7.0.39.zip
----
+
. Clone https://github.com/codice/cas-distribution to a convenient location.  This folder will be referred to as cas-distribution.
. Set up Keystores and enable SSL. There are sample configurations located within the security-cas-server-webapp project.
.. Copy setenv (cas-distribution/src/main/resources/tomcat) to TOMCAT/bin
+
.Linux
----
$ cp cas-distribution/src/main/resources/tomcat/setenv.sh <TOMCAT_INSTALLATION_DIR>/bin/
----
+
.Windows
----
copy cas-distribution\src\main\resources\tomcat\setenv.bat <TOMCAT_INSTALLATION_DIR>\bin\
----
+
.. Copy server.xml (`cas-distribution/src/main/resources/tomcat/conf`) to `<TOMCAT_INSTALLATION_DIR>/conf`
+
.Linux
----
$ cp cas-distribution/src/main/resources/tomcat/conf/server.xml <TOMCAT_INSTALLATION_DIR>/conf/
----
+
.Windows
----
$ cp cas-distribution/src/main/resources/tomcat/conf/server.xml <TOMCAT_INSTALLATION_DIR>/conf/
----
+
.. The above files point to `<TOMCAT_INSTALLATION_DIR>/certs/keystore.jks` as the default keystore location to use. This file does not come with Tomcat and needs to be created or the files copied above (setenv.sh and server.xml) need to be modified to point to the correct keystore.
+
----
mkdir <TOMCAT_INSTALLATION_DIR>/certs
----
+
Copy casKeystore.jks from the {branding} installation directory into <TOMCAT_INSTALLATION_DIR>/certs/.  This will allow CAS to use a "cas" private key and to trust anything signed by "server", "ca", or "ca-root".  
Linux  Expand source
Windows  Expand source
+
. Start Tomcat.
+
----
$ cd <TOMCAT_INSTALLATION_DIR>/bin/
$ ./startup.sh
----
+
[WARNING]
====
Make sure to run startup.bat instead of startup.sh if Windows is running on a Window machine. If setenv.sh was not converted to a .bat above, startup.bat will not function correctly.
====
+
If the Tomcat log has can exception like the following, or if you cannot access cas via port 8443 after completing the steps below:
+
----
SEVERE: Failed to initialize end point associated with ProtocolHandler ["http-apr-8443"]
java.lang.Exception: Connector attribute SSLCertificateFile must be defined when using SSL with APR
----
+
uncomment the following in server.xml:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<Listener className="org.apache.catalina.security.SecurityListener" />
----
+
then comment out:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<Listener className="org.apache.catalina.core.AprLifecycleListener" SSLEngine="on" />
----
+
. Deploy the {branding} CAS WAR to Tomcat.
+
.. Obtain the CAS WAR by building it from cas-distribution.
.. Copy it into the webapps folder on Tomcat:
+
----
$ cp cas-distribution/target/cas.war <TOMCAT_INSTALLATION_DIR>/webapps/
----

CAS should now be running on the Tomcat server. To verify it started without issues, check the Tomcat log and look for lines similar to the following:
----
Apr 25, 2013 10:55:39 AM org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig deployWAR
INFO: Deploying web application archive /apache-tomcat-7.0.39/webapps/cas.war
2013-04-25 10:55:42,831 INFO [org.jasig.cas.services.DefaultServicesManagerImpl] - <Loaded 1 services.>
2013-04-25 10:55:43,540 INFO [org.jasig.cas.util.AutowiringSchedulerFactoryBean] - <Starting Quartz Scheduler now>
----
CAS will try to authenticate first with X.509 (using the keystore provided as the truststore) and failover to LDAP username/password.
The {branding} distribution of CAS is configured to use the embedded {branding} instance running on localhost. Configuring the LDAP location may be performed by modifying the bottom of the `cas.properties` file located in `TOMCAT/webapps/cas/WEB-INF/` after the web application is deployed.

===== Configure an Existing CAS Installation
If upgrading an existing CAS installation or using the standard CAS web application, refer to the Configure CAS for LDAP page or the Configure CAS for X509 User Certificates page for directions on specific configurations that need to be performed.

[WARNING]
====
As part of setting up the server, it is critical to make sure that Tomcat trusts the {branding} server certificate and that {branding} trusts the certificate from Tomcat. If this is not done correctly, CAS and/or {branding} will throw certificate warnings in their logs and will not allow access.
====

==== Configure CAS for {branding}
When configuring CAS to integrate with {branding}, there are two main configurations that need to be modified. By default, {branding} uses 'server' as the hostname for the local {branding} instance and 'cas' as the hostname for the CAS server.

===== CAS Client
The CAS client bundle contains CAS client code that can be used by other bundles when validating and retrieving tickets from CAS. This bundle is extensively used when performing authentication. 

When setting up {branding}, the 'Server Name' and 'Proxy Callback URL' must be set to the hostname of the local {branding} instance.

The 'CAS Server URL' configuration should point to the hostname of the CAS server and should match the SSL certificate that it is using.

===== CAS Token Validator
The 'CAS Server URL' configuration should point to the hostname of the CAS server and should match the SSL certificate that it is using.

===== Additional Configuration
Information on each of the CAS-specific bundles that come with {branding}, as well as their configurations, can be found on the Security CAS application page.

==== Example Workflow
The following is a sample workflow hat shows how CAS integrates within the {branding} WSS Implementation.

. User points browser to {branding} Query Page.
. CAS servlet filters are invoked during request. 
. Assuming a user is not already signed in, the user is redirected to CAS login page.
.. For X.509 authentication, CAS will try to obtain a certificate from the browser. Most browsers will prompt the user to select a valid certificate to use.
.. For username/password authentication, CAS will display a login page.
. After successful sign-in, the user is redirected back to {branding} Query page.
. {branding} Query Page obtains the Service Ticket sent from CAS, gets a Proxy Granting Ticket (PGT), and uses that to create a Proxy Ticket for the STS.
. The user fills in search phrase and selects *Search*.
. The Security API uses the incoming CAS proxy ticket to create a RequestSecurityToken call to the STS.
. The STS validates the proxy ticket to CAS and creates SAML assertion.
. The Security API returns a Subject class that contains the SAML assertion.
. The Query Page creates a new QueryRequest and adds the Subject into the properties map.

From step 10 forward, the message is completely decoupled from CAS and will proceed through the framework properly using the SAML assertion that was created in step 8.

=== Configuring CAS for LDAP

==== Install and Configure LDAP
{branding} comes with an embedded LDAP instance that can be used for testing. During internal testing this LDAP was used extensively.

More information on configuring the LDAP and a list of users and attributes can be found at the Embedded LDAP Configuration page.

==== Add cas-server-support-ldap-3.3.1_1.jar to CAS
Copy `thirdparty/cas-server-support-ldap-3.3.1/target/cas-server-support-x509-3.3.1_1.jar` to `${ozone-widget-framework}/apache-tomecat-${version}/webapps/cas/WEB-INF/lib/cas-server-support-ldap-3.3.1_1.jar`.

==== Add spring-ldap-1.2.1_1.jar to CAS
Copy `thirdparty/spring-ldap-1.2.1/target/spring-ldap-1.2.1_1.jar` to `${ozone-widget-framework}/apache-tomecat-${version}/webapps/cas/WEB-INF/lib/spring-ldap-1.2.1_1.jar`.

==== Modify developerConfigContext.xml
. In `${ozone-widget-framework}/apache-tomecat-${version}/webapps/cas/WEB-INF/deployerConfigContext.xml`, add the `FastBindLdapAuthenticationHandler` bean definition to the `<list>` in the property stanza with name `authenticationHandlers` of the bean stanza with id `authenticationManager`:
+
.deployerConfigContext.xml
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<bean id="authenticationManager" class="org.jasig.cas.authentication.AuthenticationManagerImpl">
 
    <!-- other property definitions -->
 
    <property name="authenticationHandlers">
        <list>

                <property name="contextSource" ref="contextSource" />
            </bean>
 
            <!-- other bean definitions -->
 
        </list>
    </property>
</bean>
----
+
. In `${ozone-widget-framework}/apache-tomecat-${version}/webapps/cas/WEB-INF/deployerConfigContext.xml`, remove the bean stanza with class `ozone3.cas.adaptors.UserPropertiesFileAuthenticationHandler` from the `<list>` of the property stanza with name `authenticationHandlers`.
. In `${ozone-widget-framework}/apache-tomecat-${version}/webapps/cas/WEB-INF/deployerConfigContext.xml`, add the contextSource bean stanza to the beans stanza:
+
.deployerConfigContext.xml
[source,xml,linenums]
----

    <property name="urls">
        <list>
            <value>ldap://localhost:1389</value>
        </list>
    </property>
    <property name="userDn" value="uid=admin,ou=system"/>
    <property name="password" value="secret"/>
</bean>

In the list stanza of the property stanza with name `credentialsToPrincipalResolver` of the bean stanza with id `AuthenticationManager`, add the `X509CertificateCredentialsToIdentifierPrincipalResolver` bean definition.  The pattern in the value attribute on the property stanza can be modified to suit your needs.  The following is a simple example that uses the first CN field in the DN as the Principal. 
+
.X509CertificateCredentialsToIdentifierPrincipalResolver
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<bean id="authenticationManager"
  class="org.jasig.cas.authentication.AuthenticationManagerImpl">
  <property name="credentialsToPrincipalResolvers">

      <!-- Other bean definitions -->

. In addition to the PrincipalResolver mentioned above, CAS comes with other resolvers that can return different representations of the user identifier. This list was obtained from the official CAS Documentation site linked at the bottom of this page.

[cols="2" options="header"]
|===

|Resolver Class
|Identifier Output

|X509CertificateCredentialsToDistinguishedNamePrincipalResolver	
|Retrieve the complete distinguished name and use that as the identifier.

|X509CertificateCredentialsToIdentifierPrincipalResolver
|Transform some subset of the identifier into the ID for the principal.

|X509CertificateCredentialsToSerialNumberPrincipalResolver	
|Use the unique serial number of the certificate.

|X509CertificateCredentialsToSerialNumberAndIssuerDNPrincipalResolver	
|Create a most-likely globally unique reference to this certificate as a DN-like entry, using the CA name and the unique serial number of the certificate for that CA.
|===

Different resolvers should be used depending on the use-case for the server. When performance external attribute lookup (e.g., attribute lookup via DIAS) it is necessary to have CAS return the full DN as the identifier and the class X509CertificateCredentialsToDistinguishedNamePrincipalResolver should be used. When using a local LDAP, however, the X509CertificateCredentialsToIdentifierPrincipalResolver class can be used to only return the username that maps directly to the LDAP username.

==== Default Certificates
To verify certificate authentication with the default CAS files you must make sure that the included testUser and testAdmin certificates are installed into your web browser. This has only been tested to work with Firefox. These certificates were provided in the Ozone Widget Framework and can be used in development environments.

* The sample certificate for testUser1 is ${ozone-widget-framework}/apache-tomcat-${version}/certs/testUser1.p12
** password: password
* The sample certificate for testAdmin1 is ${ozone-widget-framework}/apache-tomcat-${version}/certs/testAdmin1.p12
** password: password

==== External Links
For more information on CAS configuration options and what each setting means, refer to their documentation page: https://wiki.jasig.org/display/CASUM/X.509+Certificates.

=== Certificate Management 
{branding} uses certificates in two ways:
. To transmit and receive encrypted messages.
. To perform authentication of an incoming user request.
This page details general management operations of using certificates in {branding}. 

==== Default Certificates
{branding} comes with a default keystore that contains certificates. The keystore is used for different services and the certificate contained within it is aliased to "localhost".
[cols="5" options="header"]

File: etc/ws-security/server/signature.properties

File: etc/ws-security/issuer/encryption.properties

File: etc/ws-security/issuer/signature.properties

File: etc/ddf.platform.config.cfg
|Used to secure (SSL) all of the endpoints for {branding}, to perform outgoing SSL requests, sign STS SAML assertions. This also includes the admin console and any other web service that is hosted by {branding}.

|===

==== File Management
File management includes creating and configuring the files that contain the certificates. In {branding}, these files are generally Java Keystores (jks) and Certificate Revocation Lists (crl). This includes commands and tools that can be used to perform these operations.

The following tools are used:

* openssl
** Windows users can use: openssl for windows (https://code.google.com/p/openssl-for-windows/downloads/detail?name=openssl-0.9.8k_X64.zip&can=2&q=)
* The standard Java *keytool* certificate management utility (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/windows/keytool.html)
Portecle (http://portecle.sourceforge.net/) can be used for *keytool* operations if a GUI if preferred over a command line interface

===== General Certificates

====== Create a CA Key and Certificate
The following steps define the procedure for creating a root CA to sign certificates.

. Create a key pair. +
 `$> openssl genrsa -aes128 -out root-ca.key 1024`
. Use the key to sign the CA certificate. +
`$> openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -key root-ca.key -out root-ca.crt`

====== Use the CA to Sign Certificates
The following steps define the procedure for signing a certificate for the tokenissuer user by a CA.

.  Generate a private key and a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). +
`$> openssl req -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout tokenissuer.key -out tokenissuer.req`
.  Sign the certificate by the CA. +
`$> openssl ca -out tokenissuer.crt -infiles tokenissuer.req`

===== Java Keystore (JKS)

====== Create a New Keystore/Truststore with an Existing Certificate and Private Key
.  Using the private key, certificate, and CA certificate, create a new keystore containing the data from the new files.
+
[source]
----
cat client.crt >> client.key
openssl pkcs12 -export -in client.key -out client.p12
keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore client.p12 -destkeystore clientKeystore.jks -srcstoretype pkcs12 -alias 1
keytool -changealias -alias 1 -destalias client -keystore clientKeystore.jks
keytool -importcert -file ca.crt -keystore clientKeystore.jks -alias "ca" 
keytool -importcert -file ca-root.crt -keystore clientKeystore.jks -alias "ca-root"
----
+
.  Create the truststore using just the CA certificate. Based on the concept of CA signing, the CA should be the only entry needed in the truststore.
+
----
keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias "ca" -file ca.crt -keystore truststore.jks
keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias "ca-root" -file ca-root.crt -keystore truststore.jks
----
+
. Create a PEM file using the certificate, as it is the format that some applications use.
+
----
openssl x509 -in client.crt -out client.der -outform DER
openssl x509 -in client.der -inform DER -out client.pem -outform PEM
----

====== Import into a Java Keystore (JKS)

The following steps define the procedure for importing a PKCS12 keystore generated by openssl into a Java keystore (JKS).

.  Put the private key and the certificate into one file. +
`$> cat tokenissuer.crt >> tokenissuer.key`
.  Put the private key and the certificate in a PKCS12 keystore. +
`$> openssl pkcs12 -export -in tokenissuer.key -out tokenissuer.p12`
.  Import the PKCS12 keystore into a JKS. +
`$> keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore tokenissuer.p12 -destkeystore stsKeystore.jks -srcstoretype pkcs12 -alias 1`
.  Change the alias. +
`$> keytool -changealias -alias 1 -destalias tokenissuer`

===== Certificate Revocation List (CRL)

====== Create a Certificate Revocation List (CRL)

.  Using the CA create in the above steps, create a CRL in which the tokenissuer's certificate is valid. +
`$> openssl ca -gencrl -out crl-tokenissuer-valid.pem`

====== Revoke a Certificate and Create a New CRL that Contains the Revoked Certificate
----
$> openssl ca -revoke tokenissuer.crt
 
$> openssl ca -gencrl -out crl-tokenissuer-revoked.pem
----

====== View a CRL

. Use the following command to view the serial numbers of the revoked certificates:
`$> openssl crl -inform PEM -text -noout -in crl-tokenissuer-revoked.pem`

==== Configuration Management
Configuration management includes configuring {branding} to use existing certificates and defining configuration options for the system. This includes configuration certificate revocation and keystores.

===== Certificate Revocation Configuration

====== Enable Revocation

. Place the CRL in `<ddf.home>/etc/keystores`.
. Uncomment the following line in `<ddf.home>/etc/ws-security/server/encryption`.properties and replace the file name with the CRL file used in step 1. +
`#org.apache.ws.security.crypto.merlin.x509crl.file=etc/keystores/crlTokenissuerValid.pem`

====== Add Revocation to a New Endpoint
This guide assumes that the endpoint being created uses CXF and is being started via Blueprint from inside the OSGi container. If other tools are being used, the configuration may differ. The CXF WS-Security page (http://cxf.apache.org/docs/ws-securitypolicy.html) contains additional information and samples.

. Add the following property to the jaxws endpoint in the endpoint's blueprint.xml: +
`<entry key="ws-security.enableRevocation" value="true"/>`
+
Example xml snippet for the jaxws:endpoint with the property:
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jaxws:endpoint id="Test" implementor="#testImpl"
                wsdlLocation="classpath:META-INF/wsdl/TestService.wsdl"
                address="/TestService">
 
    <jaxws:properties>
        <entry key="ws-security.enableRevocation" value="true"/>
    </jaxws:properties>
</jaxws:endpoint>
----

====== Verify Revocation Is Taking Place

A warning similar to the following will be displayed in the logs of the source and endpoint showing the exception encountered during certificate validation:

=== Encryption Service

The encryption service and encryption command, which are based on Jasypt (http://www.jasypt.org/), provide an easy way for developers to add encryption capabilities to {branding}.

==== Encryption Command
An encrypt security command is provided with {branding} that allows plain text to be encrypted. This is useful when displaying password fields in a GUI.

Below is an example of the security:encrypt command used to encrypt the plain text "myPasswordToEncrypt". The output, `bR9mJpDVo8bTRwqGwIFxHJ5yFJzatKwjXjIo/8USWm8=`, is the encrypted value.

----
ddf@local>security:encrypt myPasswordToEncrypt
  
bR9mJpDVo8bTRwqGwIFxHJ5yFJzatKwjXjIo/8USWm8=
----

=== Redaction and Filtering

Redaction and filtering are performed in a Post Query plugin that occurs after a query has been performed. 

==== How Redaction and Filtering Works
Each metacard result will contain security attributes that are pulled from the metadata record after being processed by a PostQueryPlugin that populates this attribute. The security attribute is a HashMap containing a set of keys that map to lists of values. The metacard is then processed by a filter/redaction plugin that creates a KeyValueCollectionPermission from the metacard's security attribute. This permission is then checked against the user subject to determine if the subject has the correct claims to view that metacard. The decision to filter/redact* the metacard eventually relies on the installed PDP (features:install security-pdp-java OR features:install security-pdp-xacml). The PDP that is being used returns a decision, and the metacard will either be filtered/redacted or allowed to pass through.

[NOTE]
====
*The default setting is to redact records*.
====

The security attributes populated on the metacard are completely dependent on the type of the metacard. Each type of metacard must have its own PostQueryPlugin that reads the metadata being returned and populates the metacard's security attribute. If the subject or resource (metacard) permissions are missing during redaction, that resource is redacted.

Example (represented as simple XML for ease of understanding):
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<metacard>
    <security>
        <map>
            <entry key="entry1" value="A,B" />
            <entry key="entry2" value="X,Y" />
            <entry key="entry3" value="USA,GBR" />
            <entry key="entry4" value="USA,AUS" />
        </map>
    </security>
</metacard>
----

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<user>
    <claim name="claim1">
        <value>A</value>
        <value>B</value>
    </claim>
    <claim name="claim2">
        <value>X</value>
        <value>Y</value>
    </claim>
    <claim name="claim3">
        <value>USA</value>
    </claim>
    <claim name="claim4">
        <value>USA</value>
    </claim>
</user>
----

In the above example, the user's claims are represented very simply and are similar to how they would actually appear in a SAML 2 assertion. Each of these user (or subject) claims will be converted to a KeyValuePermission object. These permission objects will be implied against the permission object generated from the metacard record. In this particular case, the metacard might be allowed if the policy is configured appropriately because all of the permissions line up correctly.

==== Redaction Policies
The procedure for setting up a policy differs depending on which PDP implementation installed. The `security-pdp-java` implementation is the simplest PDP to use, so it will be covered here.

. Open the http://localhost:8181/system/console/configuration.*
. Click on the Authz Security Settings configuration.
. Add any roles that are allowed to access protected services.
. Add any SOAP actions that are not to be protected by the PDP.
. Add any attribute mappings necessary to map between subject claims and metacard values.
.. For example, the above example would require two Match All mappings of claim1=entry1 and claim2=entry2
.. Match One mappings would contain claim3=entry3 and claim4=entry4.

[NOTE]
====
See the Security PDP AuthZ Realm section of this documentation for a description of the configuration page.
====

With the security-pdp-java feature configured in this way, the above Metacard would be displayed to the user.

The XACML PDP is explained in more detail in the XACML Policy Decision Point (PDP) section of this documentation. It the administrator's responsibility to write a XACML policy capable of returning the correct response message. The Java-based PDP should perform adequately in most situations. It is possible to install the security-pdp-java and security-pdp-xacml features at the same time. The system could be configured in this way in order to allow the Java PDP to handle most cases and only have XACML policies to handle more complex situations than what the Java PDP is designed for. Keep in mind that this would be a very complex configuration with both PDPs installed, and this should only be performed if you understand the complex details.

==== Redact a New Type of Metacard
To enable redaction/filtering on a new type of record, implement a PostQueryPlugin that is able to read the string metadata contained within the metacard record. The plugin must set the security attribute to a map of list of values extracted from the metacard. Note that in {branding}, there is no default plugin that populates the security attribute on the metacard. A plugin must be created to populate these fields in order for redaction/filtering to work correctly.

Example redacted record:

=== Security Token Service
The Security Token Service (STS) is a service running in {branding} that allows clients to request SAML v2.0 assertions.  These assertions are then used to authenticate a client allowing them to issue other requests, such as ingests or queries to {branding} services.  

The STS is an extension of Apache CXF-STS.  It is a SOAP web service that utilizes WS-Security policies. The generated SAML assertions contain attributes about a user and is used by the Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) in the secure endpoints. Specific configuration details on the bundles that come with {branding} can be found on the Security STS application page. This page details all of the STS components that come out of the box with {branding}, along with configuration options, installation help, and which services they import and export.

==== Using the Security Token Service (STS)
Once installed, the STS can be used to request SAML v2.0 assertions via a SOAP web service request. Out of the box, the STS supports authentication from existing SAML tokens, CAS proxy tickets, username/password, and x509 certificates. It also supports retrieving claims using LDAP.

===== Standalone Installation
The STS cannot currently be installed on a kernel distribution of {branding}. To run a STS-only {branding} installation, uninstall the catalog components that are not being used. The following list displays the features that can be uninstalled to minimize the runtime size of {branding} in an STS-only mode. This list is not a comprehensive list of every feature that can be uninstalled; it is a list of the larger components that can be uninstalled without impacting the STS functionality.  

.Unnecessary Features
* catalog-core-standardframework
* catalog-solr-embedded-provider
* catalog-opensearch-endpoint
* catalog-opensearch-souce
* catalog-rest-endpoint

==== STS Claims Handlers
Claims handlers are classes that convert the incoming user credentials into a set of attribute claims that will be populated in the SAML assertion. An example in action would be the LDAPClaimsHandler that takes in the user's credentials and retrieves the user's attributes from a backend LDAP server. These attributes are then mapped and added to the SAML assertion being created. Integrators and developers can add moreclaims handlers that can handle other types of external services that store user attributes.

===== Add a Custom Claims Handler

====== Description
A claim is an additional piece of data about a principal that can be included in a token along with basic token data. A claims manager provides hooks for a developer to plug in claims handlers to ensure that the STS includes the specified claims in the issued token.

====== Motivation
A developer may want to add a custom claims handler to retrieve attributes from an external attribute store. 
====== Steps
The following steps define the procedure for adding a custom claims handler to the STS.

. The new claims handler must implement the org.apache.cxf.sts.claims.ClaimsHander interface.

. Deploy the bundle.

If the new claims handler is hitting an external service that is secured with SSL, a developer may have to add the root CA of the external site to the {branding} trustStore and add a valid certificate into the {branding} keyStore. Doing so will allow the SSL to encrypt messages that will be accepted by the external service. For more information on certificates, refer to the Configuring a Java Keystore for Secure Communications page.

==== Example Request and Responses for a SAML Assertion
A client performs a RequestSecurityToken operation against the STS to receive a SAML assertion. The {branding} STS offers several different ways to request a SAML assertion. For help in understanding the various request and response formats, samples have been provided. The samples are divided out into different request token types.

Most endpoints that have been used in {branding} require the X.509 PublicKey SAML assertion.

===== UsernameToken Bearer SAML Security Token Request/Response

To obtain a SAML assertion to use in secure communication to {branding}, a RequestSecurityToken (RST) request has to be made to the STS.  

A Bearer SAML assertion is automatically trusted by the endpoint. The client doesn't have to prove it can own that SAML assertion. It is the simplest way to request a SAML assertion, but many endpoints won't accept a KeyType of Bearer. 

====== Request
*Explanation*

* WS-Addressing header with Action, To, and Message ID
* Valid, non-expired timestamp
* Username Token containing a username and password that the STS will authenticate
* Issued over HTTPS
* KeyType of http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-sx/ws-trust/200512/Bearer
* Claims (optional): Some endpoints may require that the SAML assertion include attributes of the user, such as an authenticated user's role, name identifier, email address, etc. If the SAML assertion needs those attributes, the RequestSecurityToken must specify which ones to include.

====== Response
This is the response from the STS containing the SAML assertion to be used in subsequent requests to QCRUD endpoints:  

The `saml2:Assertion` block contains the entire SAML assertion.  

The `Signature` block contains a signature from the STS's private key.  The endpoint receiving the SAML assertion will verify that it trusts the signer and ensure that the message wasn't tampered with.  

The `AttributeStatement` block contains all the Claims requested. 

The `Lifetime` block indicates the valid time interval in which the SAML assertion can be used.

===== X.509 PublicKey SAML Security Token Request/Response

In order to obtain a SAML assertion to use in secure communication to {branding}, a RequestSecurityToken (RST) request has to be made to the STS. 

An endpoint's policy will specify the type of security token needed.  Most of the endpoints that have been used with {branding} require a SAML v2.0 assertion with a required KeyType of http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-sx/ws-trust/200512/PublicKey.  This means that the SAML assertion provided by the client to a {branding} endpoint must contain a SubjectConfirmation block with a type of "holder-of-key" containing the client's public key.  This is used to prove that the client can possess the SAML assertion returned by the STS. 

====== Request
*Explanation*
The STS that comes with {branding} requires the following to be in the RequestSecurityToken request in order to issue a valid SAML assertion.  See the request block below for an example of how these components should be populated.
* WS-Addressing header containing Action, To, and MessageID blocks
* Valid, non-expired timestamp
* Issued over HTTPS
* TokenType of http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/oasis-wss-saml-token-profile-1.1#SAMLV2.0
* KeyType of http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-sx/ws-trust/200512/PublicKey
* X509 Certificate as the Proof of Possession or POP.  This needs to be the certificate of the client that will be both requesting the SAML assertion and using the SAML assertion to issue a query
* Claims (optional): Some endpoints may require that the SAML assertion include attributes of the user, such as an authenticated user's role, name identifier, email address, etc.  If the SAML assertion needs those attributes, the RequestSecurityToken must specify which ones to include.
** UsernameToken: If Claims are required, the RequestSecurityToken security header must contain a UsernameToken element with a username and password.

====== Response
*Explanation*
This is the response from the STS containing the SAML assertion to be used in subsequent requests to QCRUD endpoints.  

The `saml2:Assertion` block contains the entire SAML assertion.  

The `Signature` block contains a signature from the STS's private key.  The endpoint receiving the SAML assertion will verify that it trusts the signer and ensure that the message wasn't tampered with.  

The `SubjectConfirmation` block contains the client's public key, so the server can verify that the client has permission to hold this SAML assertion.   
The `AttributeStatement` block contains all of the claims requested.

=== XACML Policy Decision Point (PDP)

After unzipping the {branding} distribution, place the desired XACML policy in the <distribution root>/etc/pdp/policies directory.  This is the directory in which the PDP will look for XACML policies every 60 seconds. A sample XACML policy is located at the end of this page. Information on specific bundle configurations and names can be found on the Security PDP application page.

==== Creating a Policy
This document assumes familiarity with the XACML schema and does not go into detail on the XACML language. There are some {branding}-specific items that need to be considered when creating a policy, so it is compatible with the XACMLRealm. When creating a policy, a target is used to indicate that a certain action should be run only for one type of request. Targets can be used on both the main policy element and any individual rules. Generally targets are geared toward the actions that are set in the request.

===== Actions
For {branding}, these actions are populated by various components in the security API. The actions and their population location are identified in the following table.

[cols="1,1,1,5"]
|===

|Operation
|Action-id Value
|Component Setting the action
|Description

|Filtering / Redaction	
|filter	
|security-pdp-xacmlrealm	
|When performing any redaction or filtering, the XACMLRealm will set the action-id to "filter".

|Service	
|<SOAPAction>	
|security-pep-interceptor	
|If the PEP Interceptor is added to any SOAP-based web services for service authorization, the action-id will be the SOAPAction of the incoming request. This allows the XACML policy to have specific rules for individual services within the system.

|===

[NOTE]
====
These are only the action-id values that are currently created by the components that come with {branding}. Additional components can be created and added to {branding} to identify specific action-ids.
====

In the examples below, the policy has specified targets for the above type of calls. For the Filtering/Redaction code, the target was set for "filter", and the Service validation code targets were geared toward two services: query and LocalSiteName. In a production environment, these actions for service authorization will generally be full URNs that are described within the SOAP WSDL.

===== Attributes
Attributes for the XACML request are populated with the information in the calling subject and the resource being checked.

====== Subject
The attributes for the subject are obtained from the SAML claims and populated within the XACMLRealm as individual attributes under the urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:subject-category:access-subject category. The name of the claim is used for the *AttributeId* value. Examples of the items being populated are available at the end of this page.  

====== Resource
The attributes for resources are obtained through the permissions process. When checking permissions, the XACMLRealm retrieves a list of permissions that should be checked against the subject. These permissions are populated outside of the realm and should be populated with the security attributes located in the metacard security property. When the permissions are of a key-value type, the key being used is populated as the AttributeId value under the urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-category:resource category. 

==== Example Requests and Responses
The following items are a sample request, response, and the corresponding policy. For the XACML PDP, the request is made by the XACML realm (security-pdp-xacmlrealm), passed to the XACML processing engine (security-pdp-xacmlprocessor), which reads the policy and outputs a response.

===== Policy
This is the sample policy that was used for the following sample request and responses. The policy was made to handle the following actions: filter, query, and LocalSiteName. The filter action is used to compare subject's SUBJECT_ACCESS attributes to metacard's RESOURCE_ACCESS attributes. The query and LocalSiteName actions differ, as they are used to perform service authorization. For a query, the user must be associated with the country code ATA (Antarctica), and a LocalSiteName action can be performed by anyone.

=== Expansion Service
The Expansion Service and its corresponding expansion-related commands provide an easy way for developers to add expansion capabilities to {branding} during user attributes and metadata card processing. In addition to these two defined uses of the expansion service, developers are free to utilize the service in their own implementations.

Each instance of the expansion service consists of a collection of rule sets. Each rule set consists of a key value and its associated set of rules. Callers of the expansion service provide a key and an original value to be expanded. The expansion service then looks up the set of rules for the specified key. The expansion service then cumulatively applies each of the rules in the set starting with the original value, with the resulting set of values being returned to the caller.

[cols="3" options="header"]
|===

|Key (Attribute)	
2.1+^|Rules (original → new)

|value1	
|replacement1

|value2	
|replacement2

|value3	
|replacement3

1.2+^|key2	
|value1	
|replacement1

|value2	
|replacement2

|===
The examples below use the following collection of rule sets:

[cols="3" options="header"]
|===

|Key (Attribute)	
2.1+^|Rules (original → new)

1.3+^|Location

|AZ	
|AZ USA

|CA	
|CA USA

1.2+^|Title	
|VP-Sales	
|VP-Sales VP Sales

|VP-Engineering	
|VP-Engineering VP Engineering

|===

Note that the rules listed for each key are processed in order, so they may build upon each other, i.e., a new value from the new replacement string may be expanded by a subsequent rule.

==== Instances and Configuration
It is expected that multiple instances of the expansion service will be running at the same time. Each instance of the service defines a unique property that is useful for retrieving specific instances of the expansion service. The following table lists the two pre-defined instances used by {branding} for expanding user attributes and metacard attributes respectively.

[cols="1,3,5" options="header"]
|===
|Property Name
|Value
|Description

|mapping	
|security.user.attribute.mapping	
|This instance is configured with rules that expand the user's attribute values for security checking.

|mapping	
|security.metacard.attribute.mapping	
|This instance is configured with rules that expand the metacard's security attributes before comparing with the user's attributes.

|===
Each instance of the expansion service can be configured using a configuration file. The configuration file can have three different types of lines:
* comments - any line prefixed with the # character is ignored as a comment (for readability, blank lines are also ignored)
* attribute separator - a line starting with separator= defines the attribute separator string.
* rule - all other lines are assumed to be rules defined in a string format `<key>:<original value>:<new value>`

The following configuration file defines the rules shown above in the example table (using the space as a separator):

----
# This defines the separator that will be used when the expansion string contains multiple
# values - each will be separated by this string. The expanded string will be split at the
# separator string and each resulting attributed added to the attribute set (duplicates are
# suppressed). No value indicates the defualt value of ' ' (space).
separator=
 
# The following rules define the attribute expansion to be performed. The rules are of the
# form:
#       <attribute name>:<original value>:<expanded value>
# The rules are ordered, so replacements from the first rules may be found in the original
# values of subsequent rules.

|expand	
|Runs the expansion service on the provided data returning the expanded value.

|expansions	
|Dumps the ruleset for each active expansion service.

|===

==== Expansion Command Examples and Explanation

===== `security:expansions`
The `security:expansions` command dumps the ruleset for each active expansion service. It takes no arguments and displays each rule on a separate line in the form: `<attribute name> : <original string> : <expanded string>`. The following example shows the results of executing the expansions command with no active expansion service.

[source]
----
ddf@local>security:expansions
No expansion services currently available.
----

After installing the expansions service and configuring it with an appropriate set of rules, the expansions command will provide output similar to the following:

ddf@local>security:expansions
Location : Goodyear : Goodyear AZ
Location : AZ : AZ USA
Location : CA : CA USA
Title : VP-Sales : VP-Sales VP Sales
Title : VP-Engineering : VP-Engineering VP Engineering
----

===== `security:expand`

The security:expand command runs the expansion service on the provided data. It takes an attribute and an original value, expands the original value using the current expansion service and rule set and dumps the results. For the rule set shown above, the expand command produces the following results:

=== Configure WSS Using Standalone Servers

{branding} uses CAS as its single sign-on service. {branding} uses LDAP and STS to keep track of users and user attributes. CAS, LDAP, and STS are integral, interconnected components of the {branding} security scheme, and all can be installed on a local {branding} instance with only a few feature installs (with the exception of the CAS installation, which requires Apache Tomcat to run). Setting up these authentication components to run externally, however, is more nuanced, so this page will provide step-by-step instructions detailing the configuration process.

This page assumes that there is a keystore for each of the services/servers. If using different keystore names, substitute the name provided in this document with the desired name for your setup. For this document, the following data is used:

[cols="1,2,5"]
|===

|Server
|Keystore File
|Comments

|CAS	
|keystore.jks	
|Used on the CAS Tomcat server.

|STS	
|stsKeystore.jks	
|Used to sign SAML and as incoming connections.

|{branding}	
|serverKeystore.jks +
clientKeystore.jks
|Server used for incoming connections. +
Client used for outgoing connections.

.Login Authentication Scheme
image::login_authentication_scheme.jpg[Login Authentication Scheme]

==== ç
It is implied that the three authentication components identified below are installed on three separate servers. Therefore, it is important to keep track of the DNS hostnames used on each server for certificate authentication purposes.

===== LDAP
LDAP is used to maintain a list of trusted {branding} users and the attributes associated with them. It interacts with both CAS and the STS. The former uses LDAP to create session information, and the latter queries LDAP for user attributes and converts them to SAML claims.

. Obtain and unzip the {branding} kernel (ddf-distribution-kernel-<VERSION>.zip). 
. Start the distribution.
. Deploy the Embedded LDAP application by copying the ldap-embedded-app-<VERSION>.kar into the <DISTRIBUTION_HOME>/deploy directory. Verify that the LDAP server is installed by checking the {branding} log or by performing an la command and verifying that the OpenDJ bundle is in the active state. Additionally, it should be responding to LDAP requests on the default ports, which are 1389 and 1636.
. Copy the environment's Java keystore file into the ${DISTRIBUTION}/etc/keystores folder, making sure it overwrites the folder's existing serverKeystore.jks file.

[WARNING]
====
It is very important that the keystore file used in the process is set up to trust the hostnames used by CAS and STS. If it is not, there will be certificate authentication issues for the user.
====

===== CAS
CAS is used for SSO authentication purposes. Unlike LDAP and STS, CAS cannot be run as a {branding} bundle. CAS mustt be run through Apache Tomcat.

. Follow the instructions on the CAS installation page to install and configure Tomcat/CAS. For example, with LDAP above, the keystore.jks file that is used must trust the hostnames used by the STS server, LDAP server, and the {branding} user connecting to CAS.
. Open the ${TOMCAT}/webapps/cas/WEB-INF/cas.properties file and modify the cas.ldap.host, cas.ldap.port, cas.ldap.user.dn, and cas.ldap.password fields with your environment's LDAP information.

===== STS
The Security Token Service, unlike the LDAP, cannot currently be installed on a kernel distribution of {branding}. To run an STS-only {branding} installation,  uninstall the catalog components that are not being used. This will increase performance. A list of unneeded components can be found on the STS page.

. In the unzipped {branding} distribution folder, open /etc/org.ops4j.pax.web.cfg and find the following line:

`org.ops4j.pax.web.ssl.keystore=etc/keystores/serverKeystore.jks`
+
and change it to: 
+
`org.ops4j.pax.web.ssl.keystore=etc/keystores/stsKeystore.jks`
+
. Update the password fields to the ones you keystore uses.
. Verify that the stsKeystores.jks file in `/etc/keystores` trusts the hostnames used in your environment (the hostnames of LDAP, CAS, and any {branding} users that make use of this STS server). 
+
. Start the distribution.
. Enter the following commands to install the features used by the STS server:
+
----
features:install security-sts-server
features:install security-cas-tokenvalidator
----
+
. Open the {branding} web console as an administrator. The default user is "admin" with a password of "admin" (no quotes).
. Navigate to the Configuration tab.
. Open the Security STS LDAP Login configuration.
. Verify that the *LDAP URL*, *LDAP Bind User DN*, and *LDAP Bind User Password* fields match your LDAP server's information. The default {branding} LDAP username is "cn=user", and the default password is "secret" (no quotes) . In a production environment, the username and password should be changed in the LDAP data file.
. Select the *Save* button.
. Open the *Security STS LDAP and Roles Claims Handler* configuration.
. Populate the same URL, user, and password fields with your LDAP server information. 
. Select the *Save* button.
. Open the *Security STS CAS Token Validator* configuration.
. Under *CAS Server URL*, type the URL for your CAS server. 
. Select the *Save* button.
. Open the Platform Global Configuration. 
.. Change the protocol to https. 
.. Populate the host/port information with the STS server's host/port. For STS, the default port is 8993. 
.. Update the *Trust Store* and *Key Store* location/password fields with your environment's .jks files. 
.. Select the Save button.

All of the authentication components should be running and configured at this point. The final step is to configure a {branding} instance, so this authentication scheme is used.

==== Configure {branding}
Once everything is configured and running, hooking up an existing {branding} instance to the authentication scheme is performed by setting a few configuration properties.

. Verify that the `${DISTRIBUTION}/etc/keystores` folder is updated with the correct keystores for your operating environment.
. Start the distribution.
. Enter the following commands to install the CAS features:+
+
----
features:install security-cas-cxfservletfilter
----
+
. Open the *Security CAS Client* configuration. 
.. Under *Server Name* and *Proxy Callback URL*, replace the hostname of 'server' with your server hostname.
.. Under *CAS Server URL*, enter the hostname for the CAS server.
. Open the *Security STS Client* configuration. Verify that the host/port information in the *STS Address* field points to your STS server.
. Open the *Platform Global Configuration*. 
.. Change the protocol to https.
.. Populate the host/port information with the {branding} instance's host/port. For {branding}, the default port is 8993.
.. Update the *Trust Store* and *Key Store* location/password fields with your environment's .jks files.
. Select the *Save* button.

The {branding} should now use the CAS/STS/LDAP servers when it attempts to authenticate a user upon an attempted log in.

=== Hardening

These instructions demonstrate how to harden a {branding} system for a more secure installation.

[WARNING]
====
The web administration console is not compatible with Internet Explorer 7.
====

==== Disable the Web Console
To harden {branding} for security purposes, disable the Web Console, so users do not have access. All configuration is performed using the {branding} command line console and/or .cfg configuration files.

. Open the Web Console: http://localhost:8181/system/console.
. Enter the username (default is "admin") and the password (default is "admin").
. Select the Features tab.
. Select the *Install/Uninstall* button to uninstall the webconsole-base feature. If attempting to access a page on the Web Console, an HTTP 404 error occurs.
. To re-enable the Web Console, open the Karaf command line console and install the `ddf-webconsole` feature.

----
features:install webconsole
----

==== Enable SSL for Clients
In order for outbound secure connections (HTTPS) to be made from components like Federated Sources and Resource Readers configuration may need to be updated with keystores and security properties. These values are configured in the `<DDF_INSTALL_DIR>/etc/system.properties` file. The following values can be set:

[cols="3" options="header"]
|===

|Property
|Sample Value
|Description

|javax.net.ssl.trustStore	
|etc/keystores/serverKeystore.jks	
|The java keystore that contains the trusted public certificates for Certificate Authorities (CA's) that can be used to validate SSL Connections for outbound TLS/SSL connections (e.g. HTTPS). When making outbound secure connections a handshake will be done with the remote secure server and the CA that is in the signing chain for the remote server's certificate must be present in the trust store for the secure connection to be successful.

|javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword
|changeit
|This is the password for the truststore listed in the above property

|javax.net.ssl.keyStore
|etc/keystores/serverTruststore.jks
|The keystore that contains the private key for the local server that can be used to signing and encryption. This must be set if establishing outgoing 2-way (mutual) SSL connections where the local server must also present it's certificate for the remote server to verify.

|javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword
|changeit
|The password for the keystore listed above

|javax.net.ssl.keyStoreType	
|jks	
|The type of keystore

|https.cipherSuites	
|TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,
TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,
TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
|The cipher suites that are supported when making outbound HTTPS connections
https.protocols	 TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2	The protocols that are supported when making outbound HTTPS connections

===== Configure {branding} without the Web Administration Console

[NOTE]
====
Depending on the environment, it may be easier for integrators and administrators to configure {branding} using the Web Console prior to disabling it and switching to SSL. The Web Console can be re-enabled for additional configuration changes.
====
In an environment hardened for security purposes, access to the {branding} Web Console is denied. It is necessary to configure {branding} (e.g., providers, Schematron rulesets, etc.) using .cfg configuration files or the Karaf command line console. The OSGi container detects the addition, updating, or deletion of `.cfg` files in the `etc/ddf` directory.
The following sections describe how to configure each {branding} item using both of these mechanisms. A template file is provided for each configurable {branding} item so that it can be copied/renamed then modified with the appropriate settings.

[WARNING]
====
If at a later time the Web Console is enabled again, all of the configuration done via .cfg files and/or the Karaf command line console are loaded and displayed. However, note that the name of the .cfg file is not used in the admin console. Rather, OSGi assigns a universally unique identifier (UUID) when the {branding} item was created and displays this UUID in the console (e.g., OpenSearchSource.112f298e-26a5-4094-befc-79728f216b9b)
====

===== Configure Using a .cfg File Template
The following steps define the procedure for configuring a new source or feature using a config file.

. Copy/rename the provided template file in the etc/templates directory to the etc directory. (Refer to the table above to determine correct template.)
.. *Mandatory*: The dash between the PID (e.g., `OpenSearchSource_site.cfg`) and the instance name (e.g., `OpenSearchSource_site.cfg`) is required. The dash is a reserved character used by OSGi that identifies instances of a managed service factory that should be created.
.. Not required, but a good practice is to change the instance name (e.g., `federated_source`) of the file to something identifiable (`source1- ddf`).
. Edit the copied file to etc with the settings for the configuration. (Refer to the table above to determine the configurable properties).
.. This file is a Java properties file, hence the syntax is `<key>` = `<value>`.
.. Consult the inline comments in the file for guidance on what to modify.
.. The Configurable Properties tables in the Integrator's Guide for the Included Catalog Components also describe each field and its value.

The new service can now be used as if it was created using the Web Console.

===== Configure Using the Command Line Console

Configuring a new source, provider, or feature using the command console follows a standard procedure. The properties and their values will change based on type of service being created, but the actual commands entered at the command line do not 	change. To help illustrate the commands, an example of creating a new OpenSearch federated source is shown after each step.

. Create the federated source using the config:edit command.
.. *Mandatory*: The dash between the PID (e.g., `OpenSearchSource_site.cfg`) and the instance name (e.g., `OpenSearchSource_site.cfg`) is required. The dash is a reserved character used by OSGi that identifies instances of a managed service factory that should be created.
+
----
config:edit OpenSearchSource-my_federated_source
----
+
. Enter the settings for the federated source's properties. These properties can be found in the template file for the specified service.
+
----
config:propset endpointUrl http://ddf:8181/services/query?q={searchTerms}&amp;src={fs:routeTo?}&amp;mr={fs:maxResults?}&amp;count={count?}&amp;mt={fs:maxTimeout?}&amp;dn={idn:userDN?}&amp;lat={geo:lat?}&amp;lon={geo:lon?}&amp;radius={geo:radius?}&amp;bbox={geo:box?}&amp;polygon={geo:polygon?}&amp;dtstart={time:start?}&amp;dtend={time:end?}&amp;dateName={cat:dateName?}&amp;filter={fsa:filter?}&amp;sort={fsa:sort?}
----
+
. Save the configuration updates.
+
----
config:update
----
+
. The new service can now be used as if it was created using the Web Console.

=== Directory Permissions

.{branding}_HOME
[NOTE]
====
{branding} is installed in the {branding}_HOME directory.
====

==== Directory Permissions on Windows
Restrict access to sensitive files by ensuring that the only users with access privileges are administrators.  

. Right-click on the file or directory noted below then select *Full Control → Administrators → System*.
. Click *Properties → Security → Advanced* and select Creator Owner for `DDF_HOME` (e.g., `C:\ddf`).
. Restrict access to sensitive files by ensuring that only *System* and *Administrators* have Full Control to the below files by right-clicking on the file or directory below then selecting *Properties → Security → Advanced*.
. Delete any other groups or users listed with access to `DDF_HOME/etc` and `DDF_HOME/deploy`.

==== Directory Permissions on *NIX
Protect the {branding} from unauthorized access.

. As root, change the owner and group of critical {branding} directories to the NON_ROOT_USER.
+
[WARNING]
====
A NON_ROOT_USER (e.g., ddf) is recommended for installation.
====
+
[source, bash, linenums]
----
chown -R NON_ROOT_USER $DDF_HOME $DDF_HOME/etc $DDF_HOME/data 
chgrp -R NON_ROOT_USER $DDF_HOME/etc $DDF_HOME/data
chmod -R og-w $DDF_HOME/etc $DDF_HOME/data
----
+
. Restrict access to sensitive files by ensuring that the only users with “group” permissions (e.g., ddf-group) have access.
. Execute the following command on the above files (examples assume {branding}_HOME is /opt/ddf):
+
[source,bash]
----
chmod -R o /opt/ddf
----
+
. As the the application owner (e.g., ddf user), restrict access to sensitive files.
+
[source,bash,linenums]
----
chmod 640 /opt/ddf/etc
chmod 640 /opt/ddf/deploy
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The system administrator must restrict certain directories to ensure that the application (user) cannot access restricted directories on the system. For example the NON_ROOT_USER should only have read access to `/opt/ddf`.
====

=== Deployment Guidelines

{branding} relies on the Directory Permissions of the host platform to protect the integrity of the {branding} during operation. System administrators should perform the following steps when deploying bundles added to the {branding}.

. Prior to allowing a hot deployment, check the available storage space on the system to ensure the deployment will not exceed the available space.
. Set maximum storage space on the `DDF_HOME/deploy` and `DDF_HOME/system` directories to restrict the amount of space used by deployments.
. Do not assume the deployment is from a trusted source; verify its origination.
. Use the source code to verify a deployment is required for {branding} to prevent unnecessary/vulnerable deployments.

==== Endpoint Schema Validation
SOAP Web Services may have WSDL validation enabled. Ensure that the bundle has WSDL schema validation enabled. These instructions assume the implementation made use of the Spring beans model. All {branding} endpoint bundles follow this model.

. Prior to deploying a bundle/feature, verify the schema validation if it is a {branding} endpoint.
. Modify the `beans.xml` file
.. In a terminal window, change directory to the feature directory under the {branding} installation directory.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd DDF_HOME/system/com/lmco/ddf/endpoint-bundle.jar
----
+
Unzip the endpoint-bundle.jar.
+
[source,bash]
----
unzip endpoint-bundle.jar
----
+
.. Change directory to the `beans.xml` file.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd META-INF/spring
----
.. Open the `beans.xml` file in an editor (e.g., vi).
.. Search for `schema-validation-enabled` and change its value to true.
+
[source,bash]
----
<entry key="schema-validation-enabled" value="true"/>
----
.. Save and close the file.
.. Change directory to the feature directory,
+
[source,bash]
----
cd ../..
----
+
. Recreate the jar file (use zip or another archive tool).
+
[source,bash]
----
zip endpoint-bundle.jar *
----
+
. Re-install the feature.
.. Open the Web browser and navigate to the {branding} Web Console,
.. Select the Install button. Schema validation is now enabled for the endpoint.

=== Assuring Authenticity

{branding} Artifacts in the JAR file format (such as bundles or {branding} applications packaged as KAR files) can be signed and verified using the tools included as part of the Java Runtime Environment.

==== Prerequisites
To work with Java signatures, a keystore/truststore is required. For the purposes of this example we'll sign and validate using a self signed certificate which can be generated with the keytool utility. In production a certificate issued from a trusted Certificate Authority should be used.

Additional documentation on keytool can be found at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/windows/keytool.html

Note the last line: _jar verified_. This indicates that the signatures used to sign the JAR (or in this case, KAR) were valid according to the trust relationships specified by the keystore.

=== Security

==== Manage Users and Passwords
The default security configuration uses a property file located in `DDF_HOME/etc/user`.properties to store users and passwords.

The default Web Console user is "admin" (no quotes) with a password of "admin" (no quotes). Change this password to a more secure password by editing this file.

.user.properties
----
Format:
USER=PASSWORD,ROLE1,ROLE2,....
 
Current default:
admin=admin,admin
----

==== Enable Password Encryption
In the {branding} Text Console, enter the following commands:

.Enable Password Encryption
----
ddf@local> config:edit --force org.apache.karaf.jaas
ddf@local> config:propset encryption.enabled true
ddf@local> config:update
ddf@local> dev:restart
----

The passwords will then be encrypted in the `users.properties` file once {branding} restarts.

==== Known Issues
A system administrator must block visual access to the screen when administering passwords for particular components, such as the OpenSearch source. This is a known issue and will be addressed in a future version of {branding}.

== Starting {branding}

Follow the below steps to start and stop {branding}.

=== Start {branding}

==== *NIX

Run the following script from a command shell to start the distribution and open a local console:

----
DDF_INSTALL/bin/ddf
----

==== Windows

Run the following script from a console window to start the distribution and open a local console:

----
DDF_INSTALL/bin/ddf.bat
----

=== Stop {branding}
There are two options:

* Call shutdown from the console:

.Shut down with a prompt
----
ddf@local>shutdown
----

.Force Shutdown without prompt
----
ddf@local>shutdown -f 
----

* Or run the stop script:

.*NIX
----
DDF_INSTALL/bin/stop
----

.Windows
----
DDF_INSTALL/bin/stop.bat
----

.Shut Down
[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not shut down by closing the window (Windows, Unix) or using the `kill -9 <pid>` command (Unix). This prevents a clean shutdown and can cause significant problems when
{branding} is restarted. Always use the shutdown command or the Ctrl-D shortcut (Windows) from the command line console.
====

=== Automatic Start on System Boot
Because {branding} is built on top of Apache Karaf, {branding} can use the Karaf Wrapper to enable automatic startup and shutdown.

. Create the Karaf wrapper.
+
.Within the {branding} console
----
ddf@local> features:install wrapper
ddf@local> wrapper:install -s AUTO_START -n ddf -d ddf -D "DDF Service"
----

==== Karaf Documentation

Because {branding} is built on Apache Karaf, more information on operating {branding} can be found in the Karaf documentation at http://karaf.apache.org/index/documentation.html.

== Console Commands

Once the distribution has started, users will have access to a powerful command line console. This text console can be used to manage services, install new features and applications, and manage the state of the system.

=== Access the System Console
The Command Line Shell Console is the console that is available to the user when the distribution is started manually. It may also be accessed from the Web Console through the Gogo tab or by using the `bin/client.bat` or `bin/client.sh` scripts. For more information on how to use the `client` scripts or how to remote into the the shell console, see Using Remote Instances.

==== Example Commands

===== View Bundle Status
Call `osgi:list` on the console to view the status of the bundles loaded in the distribution.

===== View Installed Features
Execute `features:list` to view the features installed in the distribution. 

[NOTE]
====
The majority of functionality and information available on the Web Console is also available on the Command Line Shell Console.
====

=== Catalog Commands

DESCRIPTION
        catalog:search
        Searches records in the catalog provider.
SYNTAX
        catalog:search [options] SEARCH_PHRASE [NUMBER_OF_ITEMS]
ARGUMENTS
        SEARCH_PHRASE
                Phrase to query the catalog provider.
        NUMBER_OF_ITEMS
                Number of maximum records to display.
                (defaults to -1)

                Interacts with the provider directly instead of the framework.

----

The `help` command provides a description of the provided command, along with the syntax in how to use it, arguments it accepts, and available options.

==== catalog:dump Options

The `catalog:dump` command was extended in {branding} version 2.5.0 to provide selective export of metacards based on date ranges.
The `--created-after` and `--created-before` options allow filtering on the date and time that the metacard was created, while `--modified-after` and `--modified-before` options allow filtering on the date and time that the metacard was last modified (which is the created date if no other modifications were made). These date ranges are exclusive (i.e., if the date and time match exactly, the metacard will not be included). The date filtering options (`--created-after`, `--created-before`, `--modified-after`, and `--modified-before`) can be used in any combination, with the export result including only metacards that match all of the provided conditions.

If no date filtering options are provided, created and modified dates are ignored, so that all metacards match.

==== Date Syntax
Supported dates are taken from the common subset of ISO8601, matching the datetime from the following syntax:
----
datetime          = time | date-opt-time
time              = 'T' time-element [offset]
date-opt-time     = date-element ['T' [time-element] [offset]]
date-element      = std-date-element | ord-date-element | week-date-element
std-date-element  = yyyy ['-' MM ['-' dd]]
ord-date-element  = yyyy ['-' DDD]
week-date-element = xxxx '-W' ww ['-' e]
time-element      = HH [minute-element] | [fraction]
minute-element    = ':' mm [second-element] | [fraction]
second-element    = ':' ss [fraction]
fraction          = ('.' | ',') digit+
offset            = 'Z' | (('+' | '-') HH [':' mm [':' ss [('.' | ',') SSS]]]
----

==== Known Command Issues

[cols="3,7" options="header"]
|===

|Issue
|Description

|Ingest more than 200,000 data files stored NFS shares may cause Java Heap Space error (Linux-only issue).
|This is an NFS bug where it creates duplicate entries for some files when doing a file list.  Depend on the OS,  some Linux machines can handle the bug better and able get a list of files but get an incorrect number of files. Others would have a Java Heap Space error because there are too many file to list.

|Ingest millions of complicated data into Solr can cause Java heap space error.
|Complicated data has spatial types and large text.

|Ingest serialized data file with scientific notation in WKT string causes RuntimeException.
|WKT string with scientific notation such as POINT (-34.8932113039107 -4.77974239601E-5) won't ingest. This occurs with serialized data format only.

=== Command Scheduler

Command Scheduler is a capability exposed through the Web Console (http://localhost:8181/system/console) that allows administrators to schedule Command Line Shell Commands to be run at specified intervals. 

==== Usage
The Command Scheduler allows administrators to schedule Command Line Shell Commands to be run in a "platform-independent" method. For instance, if an administrator wanted to use the Catalog commands to export all records of a Catalog to a directory, the administrator could write a cron job or a scheduled task to remote into the container and execute the command. Writing these types of scripts are specific to the administrator's operating system and also requires extra logic for error handling if the container is up. The administrator can also create a Command Schedule, which currently requires only two fields. The Command Scheduler only runs when the container is running, so there is no need to verify if the container is up. In addition, when the container is restarted, the commands are rescheduled and executed again. 

===== Schedule a Command

. Navigate to the Web Console (http://localhost:8181/system/console).
. Select the Configuration tab.
. Find the *Platform Command Scheduler* configuration.
. Click on the title or the + button. This will create a new configuration.
. Type the command or commands to be executed in the *Command* text field. Commands can be separated by a semicolon and will execute in order from left to right.
. Type in a positive integer for the *Interval In Seconds* field. 
. Select the *Save* button. Once the *Save* button is selected, the command is executed immediately. It's next scheduled execution begins after the amount of seconds specified in the *Interval In Seconds* field and repeats indefinitely until the container is shut down or the scheduled command is deleted.

[NOTE]
====
Scheduled Commands can be updated and deleted. To delete, click on the trash bin button to the right of the page. To update, modify the fields and click Save.
====

===== Update a Scheduled Command

. Navigate to the Web Console (http://localhost:8181/system/console).
. Select the Configuration tab.
. The scheduled commands are displayed under the *Platform Command Scheduler*. Scheduled commands use the following syntax: `ddf.platform.scheduler.Command.{GUID}`, such as `ddf.platform.scheduler.Command.4d60c917-003a-42e8-9367-1da0f822ca6e`.
. Find the configuration to modify.
. Update either the *Command* field, the *Interval In Seconds* field, or both fields. 
. Select the *Save* button. Once the *Save* button is selected, the command is executed immediately. It's next scheduled execution begins after the amount of seconds specified in the *Interval In Seconds* field and repeats indefinitely until the container is shut down or the scheduled command is deleted.

===== Command Output
Commands that normally write out to the console will write out to the distribution's log. For example, if an echo Hello World command is set to run every five seconds, the log displays the following:

.Sample Command Output in the Log
----
16:01:32,582 | INFO  | heduler_Worker-1 | ddf.platform.scheduler.CommandJob          68 | platform-scheduler   | Executing command [echo Hello World]
16:01:32,583 | INFO  | heduler_Worker-1 | ddf.platform.scheduler.CommandJob          70 | platform-scheduler   | Execution Output: Hello World
16:01:37,581 | INFO  | heduler_Worker-4 | ddf.platform.scheduler.CommandJob          68 | platform-scheduler   | Executing command [echo Hello World]
16:01:37,582 | INFO  | heduler_Worker-4 | ddf.platform.scheduler.CommandJob          70 | platform-scheduler   | Execution Output: Hello World
----

In short, administrators can view the status of a run within the log as long as INFO was set as the status level.

.Example Help
----
ddf@local>help subscriptions:list
DESCRIPTION
        subscriptions:list
        Allows users to view registered subscriptions.
SYNTAX
        subscriptions:list [options] [search phrase or LDAP filter]
ARGUMENTS
        search phrase or LDAP filter
                Subscription ID to search for. Wildcard characters (*) can be used in the ID, e.g., my*name or *123. If an id is not provided, then
                all of the subscriptions are displayed.
OPTIONS
        filter, -f
                Allows user to specify any type of LDAP filter rather than searching on single subscription ID.
                You should enclose the LDAP filter in quotes since it will often have special characters in it.
                An example LDAP filter would be:
                (& (subscription-id=my*) (subscription-id=*169*))
                which searches for all subscriptions starting with "my" and having 169 in the ID, which can be thought of as part of an IP address.
                An example of the entire quote command would be:
                subscriptions:list -f ""(& (subscription-id=my*) (subscription-id=*169*))"
        --help
                Display this help message
----

The `help` command provides a description of the command, along with the syntax on how to use it, arguments it accepts, and available options.

Note that no arguments are required for the `subscriptions:list` command. If no argument is provided, all subscriptions will be listed. A count of the subscriptions found matching the list command's search phrase (or LDAP filter) is displayed first followed by each subscription's ID.

===== List All Subscriptions

----
ddf@local>subscriptions:list
 
Total subscriptions found: 3
 
Subscription ID
my.contextual.id.v20|http://172.18.14.169:8088/mockCatalogEventConsumerBinding?WSDL
my.contextual.id.v30|http://172.18.14.169:8088/mockEventConsumerBinding?WSDL
my.contextual.id.json|http://172.18.14.169:8088/services/json-ddms/local/event/notification
----

===== List a Specific Subscription by ID

----
ddf@local>subscriptions:list "my.contextual.id.v20|http://172.18.14.169:8088/mockCatalogEventConsumerBinding?WSDL"
 
Total subscriptions found: 1
 
Subscription ID
my.contextual.id.v20|http://172.18.14.169:8088/mockCatalogEventConsumerBinding?WSDL
----

[WARNING]

===== List Subscriptions Using an LDAP Filter
The example below illustrates searching for any subscription that has "json" or "v20" anywhere in its subscription ID.

----
ddf@local>subscriptions:list -f "(|(subscription-id=*json*) (subscription-id=*v20*))"
 
Total subscriptions found: 2
 
Subscription ID
my.contextual.id.v20|http://172.18.14.169:8088/mockCatalogEventConsumerBinding?WSDL
my.contextual.id.json|http://172.18.14.169:8088/services/json-ddms/local/event/notification
----

The example below illustrates searching for any subscription that has "json" and "172.18.14.169" in its subscription ID. This could be a handy way of finding all subscriptions for a specific site.

----
ddf@local>subscriptions:list -f "(&(subscription-id=*json*) (subscription-id=*172.18.14.169*))"
 
Total subscriptions found: 1
 
Subscription ID
my.contextual.id.json|http://172.18.14.169:8088/services/json-ddms/local/event/notification

==== `subscriptions:delete` Command Usage Example
The arguments for the `subscriptions:delete` command are the same as for the `list` command, except that a search phrase or LDAP filter must be specified. If one of these is not specified an error will be displayed.
When the `delete` command is executed it will display each subscription ID it is deleting. If a subscription matches the search phrase but cannot be deleted, a message in red will be displayed with the ID. After all matching subscriptions are processed, a summary line is displayed indicating how many subscriptions were deleted out of how many matching subscriptions were found.

===== Delete a Specific Subscription Using Its Exact ID

----
ddf@local>subscriptions:delete "my.contextual.id.json|http://172.18.14.169:8088/services/json-ddms/local/event/notification"

== Ingesting Data

Ingesting is the process of getting metadata into the Catalog Framework (including via the Content Framework). Ingested files are "transformed" into a neutral format that can be search against as well as migrated to other formats and systems. There are multiple methods available for ingesting files into the {branding}.

=== File types supported
{branding} supports a wide variety of file types and data types for ingest. The {branding}'s internal Input Transformers extract the necessary data into a generalized format. {branding} supports ingest of many datatypes and commonly use file formats, such as Microsoft office products: Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and PowerPoint presentations as well as .pdf files, GeoJson and others.

=== Methods of Ingest

==== Easy (for fewer records or manual ingesting)

===== Ingest command (console)
The {branding} console application has a command line option for ingesting files

====== Usage
The syntax for the ingest command is "ingest" -t <transformer type> <file path relative to the installation path.

For XML data, run this command:
---- 
ingest -t xml examples/metacards/xml
----

===== Directory Monitor
The {branding} Content application contains a Directory Monitor feature that allows files placed in a single directory to be monitored and ingested automatically. For more information about configuring a directory to be monitored, consult Directory Monitor.

====== Usage
Simply place the desired files in the monitored directory and it will be ingested automatically. If, for any reason, the files cannot be ingested, they will be moved to an automatically created sub-folder named `.errors`. Optionally, ingested files can be automatically moved to a sub-folder called `.ingested`.

==== Medium

===== External Methods
Several third-party tools, such as curl.exe and the Chrome Advanced Rest Client, can be used to send files and other types of data to {branding} for ingest.

==== Advanced (more records, automated ingest)
The {branding} provides endpoints for both REST and SOAP services, allowing integration with other data systems and the ability to further automate ingesting data into the catalog. For further information, see Integrating Endpoints.
	
== Troubleshooting

=== Exception Starting {branding} (Windows)

==== Problem:
An exception is sometimes thrown starting {branding} on a Windows machine (x86).

If using an unsupported terminal, java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class org.fusesource.jansi.internal.Kernel32 is thrown.

==== Solution:  
Install missing Windows libraries.

Some Windows platforms are missing libraries that are required by {branding}.  These libraries are provided by the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package x64 (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15336).

=== Blank Web Console

==== Problem: 
http://localhost:8181/system/console opens as a blank page.

==== Solution:
Restart {branding}.
. Shut down {branding} from the console: +
`ddf@local>shutdown`
. Start {branding} back up:
`./ddf`
. Verify that all of the files were copied over correctly during the deploy bundles step.

=== CXF BusException

==== Problem:
The following exception is thrown:
`org.apache.cxf.BusException: No conduit initiator`

==== Solution:
Restart {branding}.
. Shut down {branding}: +
`ddf@local>shutdown`
. Start up {branding}:
`./ddf`

=== Distribution Will Not Start

==== Problem:
{branding} will not start when calling the start script defined during installation.

==== Solution:
Complete the following procedure.
. Verify that Java is correctly installed.
+
`java -version`
. This should return something similar to:
+
`java version "1.6.0_22" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_22-b04) Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM (build 17.1-b03, mixed mode)`
. If running *nix, verify that bash is installed.
+
`echo $SHELL`
. This should return:
+
`/bin/bash`
