   file name: solr-*.jar
   OWASP is getting confused by our version number being on a jar with solr in the name we are on solr 6.0+ which is not affected by this issue.

        this CVE is generating a lot of false positives it should only include jackson-dataformat-xml jar
         but it is catching all jackson dependencies unfortunately I can't fix it so if we start depending
          on a vulnerable version of jackson-dataformat-xml this will sill suppress it.
