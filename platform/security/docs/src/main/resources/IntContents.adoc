== Overview

The Security application provides authentication, authorization, and auditing services for the DDF. They comprise both a framework that developers and integrators can extend and a reference implementation that meets security requirements. More information about the security framework and how everything works as a single security solution can be found on the Managing Web Service Security page.

This guide supports integration of this application with external frameworks.

== Security CAS

The Security CAS app contains all of the services and implementations needed to integrate with the Central Authentication Server (CAS).

Information on setting up and configuring the CAS server is located on the CAS SSO Configuration page.

|Embedded LDAP Configuration

|===

=== Configuring a Standalone LDAP Server

In some production environments it is suggested that the LDAP server be run separate from the DDF installation. Due to the minimal number of dependencies that the embedded LDAP application requires, this app can be run using a minimal install of DDF that uses much less memory and CPU than a standard installation.

==== Run a Standalone Embedded LDAP Instance

. Obtain and unzip the DDF kernel (`ddf-distribution-kernel-<VERSION>.zip`). 
. Start the distribution.
. When the kernel is loaded up with the DDF logo at the command prompt, execute:
----
la
----
which is short for "list all." 

[WARNING]
====
Since the kernel does not include all apps, if you were to do a "`list`" instead of "`la`," no results would be returned at this point.
====
. Verify that all bundles are `Active`. 
. Deploy the Embedded LDAP app by copying the `ldap-embedded-app-<VERSION>.kar` file into the `<DISTRIBUTION_HOME>/deploy` directory. You can verify that theLDAP server is installed by checking the DDF log or by performing an `la` and verifying that the OpenDJ bundle is in the Active state. Additionally, it should be responding to LDAP requests on the default ports, 1389 and 1636.
. To perform any of the configurations identified below, the web console will need to be installed by executing:
----
features:install webconsole
----

==== Configuration
The configuration options are located on the standard DDF configuration web console under the title *LDAP Server*. It currently contains three configuration options.

[cols="1,7" options="header"]
|===

|Configuration Name
|Description

|LDAP Port
|Sets the port for LDAP (plaintext and StartTLS). 0 will disable the port.

|LDAPS Port
|Sets the port for LDAPS. 0 will disable the port.

|Base LDIF File
|Location on the server for a LDIF file. This file will be loaded into the LDAP and overwrite any existing entries. This option should be used when updating the default groups/users with a new LDIF file for testing. The LDIF file being loaded may contain any LDAP entries (schemas, users, groups, etc.). If the location is left blank, the default base LDIF file will be used that comes with DDF.

|===


==== Trust Certificates

For LDAPS to function correctly, it is important that the LDAP server is configured with a keystore file that trusts the clients it is connecting to and vice versa. Complete the following procedure to provide your own keystore information for the LDAP. 

. Navigate to the `/etc/keystores` folder in the kernel distribution folder.
. Find the `serverKeystore.jks` file and replace it with a keystore file valid for your operating environment.
. If the DDF kernel is running, restart it so the changes will take place

==== Connect to a Standalone LDAP Server

DDF instances can connect to an external LDAP server by installing and configuring the `security-sts-server` feature detailed here.

=== Embedded LDAP Configuration

The Embedded LDAP application contains an LDAP server (OpenDJ version 2.4.6) that has a default set of schemas and users loaded to help facilitate authentication and authorization testing.

==== Configuration

===== Start and Stop

The embedded LDAP application installs a feature with the name `ldap-embedded`. Installing and uninstalling this feature will start and stop the embedded LDAP server. This will also install a fresh instance of the server each time. If changes need to persist, stop then start the embedded-ldap-opendj bundle (rather than installing/uninstalling the feature).

All settings, configurations, and changes made to the embedded LDAP instances are persisted across DDF restarts. If DDF is stopped while the LDAP feature is installed and started, it will automatically restart with the saved settings on the next DDF start.

===== Settings

The configuration options are located on the standard DDF configuration web console under the title LDAP Server. It currently contains three configuration options.

[cols="2,6" options="header"]
|===

|Configuration Name
|Description

|LDAP Port
|Sets the port for LDAP (plaintext and StartTLS). 0 will disable the port.

|LDAPS Port
|Sets the port for LDAPS. 0 will disable the port.

|Base LDIF File
|Location on the server for a LDIF file. This file will be loaded into the LDAP and overwrite any existing entries. This option should be used when updating the default groups/users with a new ldif file for testing. The LDIF file being loaded may contain any ldap entries (schemas, users, groups..etc). If the location is left blank, the default base LDIF file will be used that comes with DDF.

|===

==== Limitations

Current limitations for the embedded LDAP instances include:

* Inability to store the LDAP files/storage outside of the DDF installation directory.  This results in any LDAP data (i.e., LDAP user information) being lost when the `ldap-embedded` feature is uninstalled.
* Cannot be run standalone from DDF. In order to run embedded-ldap, the DDF must be started.

==== External Links

==== LDAP Administration

OpenDJ provides a number of tools for LDAP administration. Refer to the OpenDJ Admin Guide (http://opendj.forgerock.org/opendj-server/doc/admin-guide/).

===== Download the Admin Tools

OpenDJ (Version 2.4.6) and the included tool suite can be downloaded at http://www.forgerock.org/opendj-archive.html.

===== Use the Admin Tools

The admin tools are located in `<opendj-installation>/bat` for Windows and `<opendj-installation>/bin` for *nix.  These tools can be used to administer both local and remote LDAP servers by setting the *host* and *port* parameters appropriately.

===== Example Commands for Disabling/Enabling a User's Account

This configuration works just like the STS Client Config for the internal STS, but produces standard requests instead of the custom DDF ones. It supports two new auth types for the context policy manager, WSSBASIC and WSSPKI.

===== Security STS Address Provider
This allows one to select which STS address will be used (e.g. in SOAP sources) for clients of this service. Default is off (internal).

=== Security STS LDAP Claims Handler

The DDF Security STS LDAP Claims Handler bundle adds functionality to the STS server that allows it to retrieve claims from an LDAP server.
It also adds mappings for the LDAP attributes to the STS SAML claims.

[NOTE]
====
All claims handlers are queried for user attributes regardless of realm.
This means that two different users with the same username in different LDAP servers will end up with both of their claims in each of their individual assertions.
====

==== Installation

This bundle is not installed by default and can be added by installing the
`security-sts-server`
 feature.

==== Configuration

===== Settings

Settings can be found in the web console under *Configuration -> Security STS LDAP and Roles Claims Handler*.

==== Security STS Server

The DDF Security STS Server is a bundle that starts up an implementation of the CXF STS. The STS obtains many of its configurations (Claims Handlers, Token Validators, etc.) from the OSGi service registry as those items are registered as services using the CXF interfaces. The various services that the STS Server imports are listed in the Implementation Details section of this page.

[NOTE]
====
The WSDL for the STS is located at the `security-sts-server/sr/main/resources/META-INF/sts/wsdl/ws-trust-1.4-service.wsdl` within the source code.

== Security PDP

The DDF Security PDP application contains services that are able to perform authorization decisions based on configurations and policies. In the DDF Security Framework, these components are called realms, and they implement the `org.apache.shiro.realm.Realm` and `org.apache.shiro.authz.Authorizer` interfaces. Although these components perform decisions on access control, enforcement of this decision is performed by components within the Security PEP application.

|Security PDP AuthZ Realm

|===

=== Security PDP AuthZ Realm

The DDF Security PDP AuthZ Realm exposes a realm service that makes decisions on authorization requests using the attributes stored within the metacard to determine if access should be granted. Unlike the Security PDP XACML Realm, this realm does not use XACML and does not delegate decisions to an external processing engine. Decisions are made based on "match-all" and "match-one" logic. The configuration below provides the mapping between user attributes and metacard attributes - one map exists for each type of mapping (each map may contain multiple values).

* Match-All Mapping:  This mapping is used to guarantee that all values present in the specified metacard attribute exist in the corresponding user attribute.

* Match-One Mapping:  This mapping is used to guarantee that at least one of the values present in the specified metacard attribute exists in the corresponding user attribute.

==== Installation

This bundle is not installed by default and can be added by installing the `security-pdp-java` feature.

==== Configuration

===== Settings

Settings can be found in the web console under *Configuration -> Security Simple AuthZ Realm*.

|Match-All Mappings
| 
|These map user attributes to metacard security attributes to be used in "Match All" checking. All the values in the metacard attribute must be present in the user attributes in order to "pass" and allow access. These attribute names are case-sensitive.

|Match-One Mappings
|
|These map user attributes to metacard security attributes to be used in "Match One" checking. At least one of the values from the metacard attribute must be present in the corresponding user attribute to "pass" and allow access. These attribute names are case-sensitive.

=== Security PDP XACML Realm

The DDF Security PDP XACML realm exposes a realm that creates a XACML request with the incoming authorization information and sends the request to a XACML processing engine. The engine that is sent the request is not hardcoded and is retrieved at runtime by the OSGi service registry. This realm contains an embedded XACML processing engine that handles the requests and policies.

== Anonymous Interceptor

The goal of the AnonymousInterceptor is to allow non-secure clients (SOAP requests without security headers) to access secure service endpoints. 

All requests to secure endpoints must include, as part of the incoming message, a user's credentials in the form of a SAML assertion or a reference to a SAML assertion. For REST/HTTP requests, either the assertion itself or the session reference (that contains the assertion) is included. For SOAP requests, the assertion is included in the SOAP header. 

Rather than reject requests without user credentials, the anonymous interceptor detects the missing credentials and inserts an assertion that represents the "anonymous" user. The attributes included in this anonymous user assertion are configured by the administrator to represent any unknown user on the current network.

=== Installing

The `AnonymousInterceptor` is installed by default with DDF Security Application.

=== Configuring

==== Configuring via the Admin Console

. Navigate to the DDF Admin Console -> Configuration
. Select “ Security STS Anonymous Claims Handler”
. Click the + next to Attributes to add a new attribute
. Add the following attribute: +
 “http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier=anonymous”
. Repeat the steps above to add another new attribute: +
 “http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier=anonymous”
. Click save
. Now select “Security Simple AuthZ Realm”
. Under role, add anonymous so Roles value is: “admin,anonymous”
. Click save.

Once these configurations have been added, the AnonymousInterceptor is ready for use. Both secure and non-secure requests will be accepted by all secure DDF service endpoints.

== Security IdP

The Security IdP application provides service provider handling that satisfies the http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-profiles-2.0-os.pdf[SAML 2.0 Web SSO profile] in order to support external IdPs (Identity Providers).

|IdP Server

|===

=== Installation

These bundles are not installed by default, they can be started by installing the `security-idp` feature.

=== Security IdP Service Provider

The IdP client that interacts with the specified Identity Provider.

==== Configuration

. Navigate to Admin Console -> DDF Security -> Configuration -> IdP Client
. Populate IdP Metadata field with an HTTPS URL (https://), file URL (file:), or XML block to refer to desired metadata (e.g., https://localhost:8993/services/idp/login/metadata)

=== Security IdP Server

An internal Identity Provider solution.

==== Configuration

. Navigate to Admin Console -> DDF Security -> Configuration -> IdP Server
. Click the + next to SP Metadata to add a new entry
. Populate the new entry with an HTTPS URL (https://), file URL (file:), or XML block to refer to desired metadata (e.g., https://localhost:8993/services/saml/sso/metadata)

=== Related Configuration

. Navigate to Admin Console -> DDF Security -> Configuration -> Web Context Policy Manager
. Under Authentication Types, set the IDP authentication type as necessary. Note that it should _only_ be used on context paths that will be accessed by users via web browsers. For example:
- /search=SAML|IDP

=== Limitations

The internal Identity Provider solution should be used in favor of any external solutions until the IdP Service Provider fully satisfies the SAML 2.0 Web SSO profile.
