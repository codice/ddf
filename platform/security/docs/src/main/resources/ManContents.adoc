== Overview

The Security application provides authentication, authorization, and auditing services for the DDF. They comprise both a framework that developers and integrators can extend and a reference implementation that meets security requirements. More information about the security framework and how everything works as a single security solution can be found on the Managing Web Service Security page.

This page documents the installation, maintenance, and support of this application.

== Install and Uninstall

=== Prerequisites

Before the DDF Security application can be installed:

* the DDF Kernel must be running
* the DDF Platform Application must be installed

=== Install

. Before installing a DDF application, verify that its prerequisites have been met. 
. Copy the DDF application's KAR file to the `<INSTALL_DIRECTORY>/deploy` directory.

[NOTE]
====
These Installation steps are the same whether DDF was installed from a distribution zip or a custom installation using the DDF Kernel zip.
====

=== Verify

. Verify the appropriate features for the DDF application have been installed using the
`features:list` command to view the KAR file's features.
. Verify that the bundles within the installed features are in an active state.

=== Uninstall

[WARNING]
====
It is very important to save the KAR file or the feature repository URL for the application prior to an uninstall so that the uninstall can be reverted if necessary.
====

If the DDF application is deployed on the DDF Kernel in a custom installation (or the application has been upgraded previously), i.e., its KAR file is in the `<INSTALL_DIRECTORY>/deploy` directory, uninstall it by deleting this KAR file.

Otherwise, if the DDF application is running as part of the DDF distribution zip, it is uninstalled *the first time and only the first time* using the `features:removeurl` command:

.Uninstall DDF application from DDF distribution
[source,terminal,linenums]
----
features:removeurl -u <DDF application's feature repository URL>

Example:   features:removeurl -u mvn:ddf.security/security-services-app/2.4.0/xml/features
----

The uninstall of the application can be verified by the absence of any of the DDF application's features in the `features:list` command output.

[NOTE]
====
The repository URLs for installed applications can be obtained by entering:

`features:listrepositories -u`
====

==== Revert the Uninstall

If the uninstall of the DDF application needs to be reverted, this is accomplished by either:

* copying the application's KAR file previously in the `<INSTALL_DIRECTORY>/deploy` directory, OR 
* adding the application's feature repository back into DDF and installing its main feature, which typically is of the form `<applicationName>-app`, e.g., `catalog-app`.

features:addurl <DDF application's feature repository URL>
features:install <DDF application's main feature>

Example:

    ddf@local>features:addurl mvn:ddf.catalog/catalog-app/2.3.0/xml/features
    ddf@local>features:install catalog-app
----

=== Upgrade

To upgrade an application, complete the following procedure.

. Uninstall the application by following the Uninstall Applications instructions above.
. Install the new application KAR file by copying the admin-app-X.Y.kar file to the `<INSTALL_DIRECTORY>/deploy` directory.
. Start the application. +
`features:install admin-app`
. Complete the steps in the Verify section above to determine if the upgrade was successful.
