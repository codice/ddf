/**
 * A list of operations that can be performed on features or bundles.
 *
 * <p><i>Note:</i> The order defined here is important and represents the order tasks will be
 * executed. When it comes to bundles, it is important to have the bundles started in the right
 * order as such we have to give priority to installation. We will then uninstall and stop
 * everything else and finish off with starting. This will make sure that we will not have 2 bundles
 * that might provide the same implementation for an API started at the same time.
 *
 * <p>The update operation is a special operation used by features where, for example, feature
 * requirements needs to be added or removed to mark the feature as required or not so it will match
 * the state it was on the original system. By Karaf's design, a required feature can be uninstalled
 * whereas as a non-required cannot. Since the goal of the profile migratable is to reset the system
 * in the exact same state it was at the time of export, updating this particular state for features
 * is also important. We therefore will do so using a final step using the {@link #UPDATE}
 * operation.
