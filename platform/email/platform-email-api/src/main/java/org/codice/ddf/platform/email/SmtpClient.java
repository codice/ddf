 * Provides a light-weight interface to javax.mail. The user should call {@link #createSession()}

 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *
 * SmtpClient smtpClient = <get an instance>
 *
 * Session session = emailService.createSession();
 *
 * MimeMessage mimeMessage = new MimeMessage(session);
 * mimeMessage.setFrom(new InternetAddress("from@test.com"));
 * mimeMessage.addRecipient(Message.RecipientType.TO, new InternetAddress("to@test.com"));
 * mimeMessage.setSubject("The Subject Line");
 *
 * BodyPart messageBodyPart = new MimeBodyPart();
 * messageBodyPart.setText("The Body Text");
 *
 * Multipart multipart = new MimeMultipart();
 * multipart.addBodyPart(messageBodyPart);
 *
 * mimeMessage.setContent(multipart);
 *
 * emailService.send(mimeMessage);
 *
 * }
