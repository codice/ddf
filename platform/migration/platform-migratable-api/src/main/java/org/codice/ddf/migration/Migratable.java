/**
 * This interface provides the mechanism for implementers to define how their data (e.g. bundle
 * specific Java properties, XML or JSON configuration files) shall be exported for later import
 * into a new system. The information exported will allow a new system to be automatically
 * configured (cloned) like the exported system. Only bundle or feature specific settings need be
 * handled. All configurations stored in OSGi's {@code ConfigurationAdmin} will automatically be
 * migrated by a migratable specifically developed for this purpose and do not need to be managed by
 * implementors of this class. The framework that handles the migratables ensures that no two
 * migratable's methods are running at the same time. Implementors do not need to program exports
 * and imports with regard to reflexive thread-safety.
 *
 * <p><b>This is the only interface that should be implemented by implementers and registered as an
 * OSGI service. All other interfaces will be implemented by the framework that provides support for
 * migratables.</b>
 *
 * <p>During an import operation, only one of {@link #doImport}, {@link #doIncompatibleImport}, or
 * {@link #doMissingImport} methods will be called by the framework.
 *
 * <p><b> This code is experimental. While this interface is functional and tested, it may change or
 * be removed in a future version of the library. </b>
