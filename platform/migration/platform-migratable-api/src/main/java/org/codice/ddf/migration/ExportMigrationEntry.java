/**
 * The <code>ExportMigrationEntry</code> interfaces provides support for artifacts that are being
 * exported during migration.
 *
 * <p>Entries created via the export migration context or via the {@link
 * #getPropertyReferencedEntry} methods are not stored in the export file. Storage of these entries
 * is controlled by the {@link Migratable} using the {@link #store} methods. This gives the
 * migratable a chance to make additional checks if need be. In some cases, the migratable might not
 * be responsible for actually migrating the content of a file and might only be responsible for
 * migrating the file being referenced by a given property. This is the case, for example, with Java
 * properties file where a migratable might be responsible for migrating the file being referenced
 * from a property in a properties file but not the properties file itself. In such case, the
 * migratable would create an entry for the properties file that holds the property in question via
 * the {link ExportMigrationContext#getEntry} and then create a migration entry for the file
 * referenced from one of its properties using the {@link #getPropertyReferencedEntry} method.
 *
 * <p>For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     public class MyMigratable implements Migratable {
 *         ...
 *
 *         public void doExport(ExportMigrationContext context) {
 *             // get an entry for my properties file
 *             final ExportMigrationEntry entry = context.getEntry(Paths.get("etc", "myfile.properties"));
 *
 *             // get an entry for the file referenced from "my.properties" and store it in the export file
 *             entry.getPropertyReferencedEntry("my.property")
 *                 .ifPresent(ExportMigrationEntry::store);
 *         }
 *
 *         ...
 *     }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b> This code is experimental. While this interface is functional and tested, it may change or
 * be removed in a future version of the library. </b>
