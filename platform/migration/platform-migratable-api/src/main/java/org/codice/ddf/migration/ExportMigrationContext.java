/**
 * The export migration context provides functionality for creating new migration entries for system
 * files and configurations, entries for references in system properties files, and tracking
 * exported migration entries for a given migratable while processing an export migration operation.
 *
 * <p>The export migration context is provided to a {@link Migratable} during the export migration
 * operation to give a migratable a chance to create new entries representing files or blobs of
 * information required for export. It also allows a migratable to indicate which system properties
 * are expected to reference files on disk that should also be migrated.
 *
 * <p>For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     public class MyMigratable implements Migratable {
 *         ...
 *
 *         public void doExport(ExportMigrationContext context) {
 *             // export a file located on disk
 *             context.getEntry(Paths.get("etc", "myfile.properties"))
 *                 .store();
 *             // export all files located under a specific sub-directory
 *             context.entries(Paths.get("etc", "subdir"))
 *                 .forEach(ExportMigrationEntry::store);
 *             // export the file referenced from the "my.property" system property
 *             context.getSystemPropertyReferencedEntry("my.property")
 *                 .ifPresent(ExportMigrationEntry::store);
 *         }
 *
 *         ...
 *     }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b> This code is experimental. While this interface is functional and tested, it may change or
 * be removed in a future version of the library. </b>
