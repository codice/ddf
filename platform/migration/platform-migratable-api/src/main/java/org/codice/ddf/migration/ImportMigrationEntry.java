/**
 * The <code>ImportMigrationEntry</code> interface provides support for artifacts that are being
 * imported during migration.
 *
 * <p>Entries retrieved via the import migration context or via the {@link
 * #getPropertyReferencedEntry} methods are not restored back on disk. Storage of these entries is
 * controlled by the {@link Migratable} using the {@link #restore} methods. This allows the
 * migratable a chance to make additional checks if need be. In some cases, the migratable might not
 * be responsible for actually migrating the content of a file and might only be responsible for
 * migrating the file being referenced by a given property in it. This is the case, for example,
 * with Java properties file where a migratable might be responsible for migrating the file being
 * referenced from a property in a properties file but not the properties file itself. In such case,
 * the migratable would retrieve an entry for the properties file that holds the property in
 * question via the {@link ImportMigrationContext#getEntry} and then retrieve a migration entry for
 * the file referenced from one of its properties using the {@link #getPropertyReferencedEntry}
 * method.
 *
 * <p>For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     public class MyMigratable implements Migratable {
 *         ...
 *
 *         public void doImport(ImportMigrationContext context) {
 *             // get an entry for my properties file
 *             final ImportMigrationEntry entry = context.getEntry(Paths.get("etc", "myfile.properties"));
 *
 *             // get an entry for the file referenced from "my.properties" and restore it back on disk
 *             entry.getPropertyReferencedEntry("my.property")
 *                 .ifPresent(ImportMigrationEntry::restore);
 *         }
 *
 *         ...
 *     }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b> This code is experimental. While this interface is functional and tested, it may change or
 * be removed in a future version of the library. </b>
