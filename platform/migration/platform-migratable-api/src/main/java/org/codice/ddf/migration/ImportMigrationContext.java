/**
 * The import migration context keeps track of exported migration entries for a given migratable
 * while processing an import migration operation.
 *
 * <p>The import migration context is provided to a {@link Migratable} during the import migration
 * operation. The migratable can retrieve new entries representing files or blobs of information
 * that may have been exported. It can also retrieve entries for system properties that reference
 * files on disk. As a result, the migratable can re-import the exported information into the new
 * system.
 *
 * <p>For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     public class MyMigratable implements Migratable {
 *         ...
 *
 *         public void doImport(ImportMigrationContext context) {
 *             // import an exported file and restore it back to disk
 *             context.getEntry(Paths.get("etc", "myfile.properties"))
 *                 .restore();
 *             // get all exported files located under a specific sub-directory and restore them back on disk
 *             context.entries(Paths.get("etc", "subdir"))
 *                 .forEach(ImportMigrationEntry::restore);
 *             // restore back on disk the file referenced from the "my.property" system property
 *             context.getSystemPropertyReferencedEntry("my.property")
 *                 .ifPresent(ImportMigrationEntry::restore);
 *         }
 *
 *         ...
 *     }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b> This code is experimental. While this interface is functional and tested, it may change or
 * be removed in a future version of the library. </b>
