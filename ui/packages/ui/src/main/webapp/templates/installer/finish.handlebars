        <p class="lead">Congratulations! Your system is now configured.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            After installation is complete there are additional configurations that can be made
            to change hostname, ports and certificates.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Global system properties can be configured in the INSTALL_HOME/etc/custom.system.properties file and certificates for the host can be added to the serverKeystore/serverTruststore in the INSTALL_HOME/etc/keystores directory.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            A system restart is required each time these files are modified in order for the changes to take effect.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Click the 'Restart Now' button below to conclude the setup and restart the system.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Click the 'Restart Later' button below to avoid restarting. A manual restart will be required to use the system.
