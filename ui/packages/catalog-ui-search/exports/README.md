This directory is intended to be representative of catalog-ui-search's public facing API.
Like a component library, this directory represents the parts of this application that are intended for re-use and extensibility.
Using this index helps us avoid making breaking changes to downstream projects by treating file locations as an implementation detail.
It also helps communicate which parts of the UI are designed for re-use and extensibility - serving as a location to find existing components.
