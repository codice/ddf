== Overview

The DDF Content application provides a framework for storing, reading, processing, transforming and cataloging data. This guide provides instructions for configuring, maintaining and operation components of the Distributed Data Framework. 

== DDF Content Framework
The DDF Content Framework is a framework for storing, reading, processing, and transforming content information. Content information is consists of files that the client wants parsed and created with a metacard that is subsequently used to create a catalog entry in the Metadata Catalog and stored in the DDF Content Repository.

The files passed into the DDF Content Framework can be of any type, e.g., NITF, PDF, Microsoft Word, etc., as long as their mime type can be resolved, an Input Transformer exists to parse their content into a metacard, and the generated metacard satisfies the constraints of the catalog provider into which the generated metacard will be inserted. For example, if the Tika Input Transformer is installed, Microsoft Office documents and PDF files can be transformed into metacards. If the Solr catalog provider is being used, the generated metacard can be successfully inserted.

Clients typically perform create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations against the content repository.  At the core of the Content functionality is the Content Framework, which routes all requests and responses through the system, invoking additional processing per the system configuration.

The DDF Content Framework has several components and an API that connects them together.  The Content API consists of the Java interfaces that define DDF functionality. These interfaces provide the ability for components to interact without a dependency on a particular underlying implementation; therefore, allowing the possibility of alternate implementations that can maintain interoperability and share developed components. As such, new capabilities can be developed independently in a modular fashion, using the Content API interfaces, and reused by other DDF installations.

The DDF Content API will evolve with DDF itself, but great care is taken to retain backwards compatibility with developed components.  Compatibility is reflected in version numbers. For more information, see the Software Versioning section in the Appendix.

==== Design

The DDF Content Framework design consists of several major components, namely endpoints, input transformers, the core Content Framework, storage providers, and Content plugins.

The endpoints provide external clients access to the Content Framework. Input transformers convert incoming content into a metacard.  The core Content Framework routes requests and responses through the system. The storage providers provide storage of the content to specific types of storage, e.g., file system, relational database, XML database. The Content plugins provide pluggable functionality that can be executed after the content has been stored/update/deleted but before the response has been returned to the client.


==== DDF Content API Packaging

The Content API consists of the Java interfaces that define the methods that this API supports. The following illustrations show these interfaces and how they are packaged.

===== Content Item

Content Item is the domain object, which is populated by the Content Endpoint from the client request, that represents the information about the content to be stored in the Storage Provider. A Content Item encapsulates the content's globally unique ID, mime type, and input stream (i.e., the actual content).

Content endpoints act as a proxy between the client and the Content Framework. Endpoints expose the client to the Content Framework.
	
Endpoint interface formats/protocols can include a variety of formats, including (but not limited to):

* SOAP Web services
* RESTful services
* JMS
* RMI
* JSON
* OpenSearch

Content endpoints provide the capability to create, read, update, and delete content in the content repository, as well as create, update, and delete metacards corresponding to the content in the Metadata Catalog.

Endpoints are the only client-accessible components in DDF.

===== Examples

The following endpoints are provided with the Content Framework out of the box:

* Content REST CRUD Endpoint

The Content Framework wires all Content components together via OSGi and the Content API.  It handles all Content operations requested by endpoints, invoking Content Plugins as needed, and for most Operations, sending the request to a Storage Provider for execution.

===== Examples

The DDF Content comes with the following Content Frameworks out of the box:

* Standard Content Framework

The DDF Content provides the capability to read, create, update, and delete content from the DDF Content Repository.

Each of these operations follow a request/response paradigm. The request is the input to the operation and contains all of the input parameters needed by the Content Framework's operation to communicate with the Storage Providers and Content Plugins. The response is the output from the execution of the operation that is returned to the client and contains all of the data returned by the Storage Providers and  Content Plugins. For each operation, there is an associated request/response pair, e.g., the CreateRequest and CreateResponse pair for the Content Framework's create operation.

All of the request and response objects are extensible in that they can contain additional key/value properties on each request/response. This allows additional capability to be added without changing the Content API, helping to maintain backwards compatibility. Refer to the Developer's Guide for details on using this extensibility.

Storage providers act as a proxy between the Content Framework and the mechanism storing the content, e.g., file system, relational database. Storage providers expose the storage mechanism to the Content Framework.

Storage providers provide the capability to the Content Framework to create, read, update, and delete content in the content repository.

===== Examples

The following storage providers are provided with the Content Framework out of the box:

* File System Storage Provider

== DDF Content Core

The `content-core` bundle is a collection of default catalog components that can be used for most situations.

=== Standard Content Framework

The Standard Content Framework provides the reference implementation of a Content Framework that implements all requirements of the Content API. `ContentFrameworkImpl` is the implementation of the Standard Content Framework.

==== Using

The Standard Content Framework is the core class of DDF Content. It provides the methods for read, create, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on the Storage Provider.

Use this framework if:

* access to a storage provider to create, update, and delete content items in the DDF Content Repository is required or
* the ability to parse content, create a metacard, and then create, update, and delete catalog entries in the Metadata Catalog based on the parsed content are required.

==== Installing and Uninstalling

The Standard Content Framework is bundled in the `content-core` feature and is part of the `content-core-app`. It can be installed and uninstalled using the normal processes described in the Configuration section.

==== Configuring

There are no configuration properties for this component. This component can only be installed and uninstalled.

==== Known Issues
None

=== Content Cataloger Plugin

The Content Cataloger Plugin provides the implementation to parse content, create a Metacard, and create, update, and delete catalog entries in the Metadata Catalog.
	
The Content Cataloger Plugin is an implementation of the ContentPlugin interface. When installed, it is invoked by the Content Framework after a content item has been processed by the Storage Provider, but before the response is returned to the Content Endpoint.

The Content Cataloger Plugin searches the OSGi service registry for all services registered as `inputTransformers` that can process the content item's mime type. If such a service is found, the service is invoked (for `create` and `update` operations; `delete` operations are handled internally by the Content Cataloger Plugin). The inputTransformer service accepts the content item's InputStream and parses it, creating a Metacard that is returned to the Content Cataloger Plugin. This Metacard is then used in the `create` and `update` operations invoked on the Catalog Framework to interface with the Metadata Catalog.

Details on how to develop an Input Transformer with either Java or Apache Camel can be found in the Developing an Input Transformer section of Extending Catalog Transformers.

==== Using

Use the Content Cataloger Plugin if create/update/delete of catalog entries in the Metadata Catalog based on the content item are desired. These CUD operations on the Metadata Catalog are made possible by parsing the content item to create a metacard and then using this metacard in the CUD operations on the Catalog Framework. The Content Cataloger Plugin is the only component in the DDF Content Framework that has the ability to interface with the Catalog Framework (and hence the Metadata Catalog).

==== Installing and Uninstalling

The Content Cataloger Plugin is bundled as the `content-core-catalogerplugin` feature and can be installed and uninstalled using the normal processes described in the Configuration
 section of the Administrator's Guide.

==== Configuring

There are no configurable properties for this component. This component can only be installed and uninstalled.

==== Known Issues

Content Cataloger Plugin is only partially transactional. On create operations where the content is being stored in the content repository and the content is being parsed to generated a metacard for insertion into the Metadata Catalog, the content storage will be undone (i.e., the recently inserted content removed from the content repository if the Metadata Catalog insertion encountered problems.) Update and delete operations have no transactional capabilities. Once the content is updated or deleted this cannot be undone. Therefore, the content repository and Metadata Catalog could get out of sync.

=== Directory Monitor

The Content Directory Monitor allows files placed in a monitored directory to be ingested into the DDF Content Repository and/or the Metadata Catalog (MDC). A monitored directory is a directory configured to be polled by DDF periodically (typically every one second) for any new files added to the directory that should be ingested into the Content Framework.

. The typical execution flow of the Directory Monitor is:
. A new file is detected in the monitored directory, 
. The file's contents are passed on to the Content Framework and processed based on whether the monitored directory's processing directive was:
.. configured to just store the file in the DDF Content Repository,
.. configured to just process the file's metadata and ingest it into the MDC, or 
.. configured to both store the file in the Content Repository and ingest it into the MDC.
. If the response from the Content Framework is successful, indicating the content was stored and/or processed, the file in the monitored directory is either deleted (default behavior) or copied to a sub-directory called `.ingested` (see below for how to configure this behavior). If the response from the Content Framework was unsuccessful or a failure occurred, the file is moved from the monitored directory to a sub-folder named `.errors`, allowing easy identification of the ingested files that had problems.

Multiple monitored directories can be configured, each monitoring different directories.

==== Using

The Content Directory Monitor provides the capability to easily create content in the DDF Content Repository and metacards in the MDC by simply placing a file in a directory that has been configured to be monitored by DDF. For example, this would be useful for copying files from a hard drive (or directory) in a batch-like operation to the monitored directory and having all of the files processed by the Content Framework.

===== Sample Usage Scenarios

====== Scenario 1: Monitor single directory for storage and processing, with no file backup

* The Content Directory Monitor has the following configurations.
** The *relative* path of `inbox` for the directory path.
** The Processing Directive is set to Store and Process.
** The *Copy Ingested Files* option is not checked.
* As files are placed in the monitored directory `<DDF_INSTALL_DIR>/inbox`, the files are ingested into the Content Framework.
** The Content Framework generates a GUID for the create request for this ingested file.
** Since the Store and Process directive was configured the ingested file is passed on to the Content File System Storage Provider, which creates a sub-directory in the Content Repository using the GUID and places the ingested file into this GUID sub-directory using the file name provided in the request.
** The Content Framework then invokes the Catalog Content Plugin, which looks up the Input Transformer associated with the ingested file's mime type and invokes the Catalog Framework, which inserts the metacard into the MDC. This Input Transformer creates a metacard based on the contents of the ingested file.
** The Content Framework sends back a successful status to the Camel route that was monitoring the directory.
** Camel route completes and deletes the file from the monitored directory.

====== Scenario 2: Monitor single directory for storage with file backup

* The Content Directory Monitor has the following configurations.
** The *absolute* path of `/usr/my/home/dir/inbox` for the directory path. 
** The Processing Directive is set to store only. 
** The *Copy Ingested Files* option is checked.
* As files are placed in the monitored directory `/usr/my/home/dir/inbox`, the files are ingested into the Content Framework.
** The Content Framework generates a GUID for the create request for this ingested file.
** Since the Store directive was configured, the ingested file is passed on to the Content File System Storage Provider, which creates a sub-directory in the Content Repository using the GUID and places the ingested file into this GUID sub-directory using the file name provided in the request.
** The Content Framework sends back a successful status to the Camel route that was monitoring the directory.
** The Camel route completes and moves the file from the monitored directory to its sub-directory `/usr/my/home/dir/inbox/.ingested`.

====== Scenario 3: Monitor multiple directories for processing only with file backup - errors encountered on some ingests

* Two different Content Directory Monitors have the following configurations.
** The *relative* path of `inbox` and `inbox2` for the directory path. 
** The Processing Directive on both directory monitors is set to Process.
** The Copy Ingested Files option is checked for both directory monitors.
* As files are placed in the monitored directory `<DDF_INSTALL_DIR>/inbox`, the files are ingested into the Content Framework.
** The Content Framework generates a GUID for the create request for this ingested file.
** Since the Process directive was configured, the ingested file is passed on to the Catalog Content Plugin, which looks up the Input Transformer associated with the ingested file's mime type (but no Input Transformer is found) and an exception is thrown.
** The Content Framework sends back a failure status to the Camel route that was monitoring the directory.
** The Camel route completes and moves the file from the monitored directory to the `.errors` sub-directory.
* As files are placed in the monitored directory `<DDF_INSTALL_DIR>/inbox2`, the files are ingested into the Content Framework.
** The Content Framework generates a GUID for the create request for this ingested file.
** The Content Framework then invokes the Catalog Content Plugin, which looks up the Input Transformer associated with the ingested file's mime type and invokes the Catalog Framework, which inserts the metacard into the MDC. This Input Transformer creates a metacard based on the contents of the ingested file.
** The Content Framework sends back a successful status to the Camel route that was monitoring the directory.
** The Camel route completes and moves the file from the monitored directory to its `.ingested` sub-directory.

==== Installing and Uninstalling

The Content Directory Monitor is packaged as the `content-core-directorymonitor` feature and is part of the `content-core-app`. It is installed by default.

It can be installed and uninstalled using the normal processes described in the Configuration section.

[NOTE]
====
Note that the `content-core-catalogerplugin` feature must be installed for the metacards to be created and inserted into the MDC. This feature provides the linkage between the Content Framework and the  Catalog Framework. If the client attempts a STORE_AND_PROCESS or a PROCESS only without this feature installed a failure will be returned.

=== File System Storage Provider

The File System Storage Provider is used to create/update/delete content items as files in the DDF Content Repository. The File System Storage Provider is an implementation of the Storage Provider interface. When installed, it is invoked by the Content Framework to create, update,or delete a file in the DDF Content Repository.

* For `create` operations, the File System Storage Provider (using the `MimeTypeMapper`) examines the mime type of the content item and determines the extension to use for the file to be stored.  The File System Storage Provider also auto-generates a Globally Unique ID (GUID) for the content item. This GUID is used as the sub-directory for the content item's location in the Content Repository. This is to insure the files in the Content Repository are more evenly distributed rather than all being stored in one monolithic directory. The content is stored using the file name specified in the create request.

As an example, if the content item's mime type was `image/nitf`, then:

** the file extension would be `.nitf`, 
** a GUID would be auto-generated (an example GUID would be `54947df8-0e9e-4471-a2f9-9af509fb5889`),
** the file name is specified in the `create` request (example: myfile.nitf), and
** the location in the Content Repository would be determined based on the GUID and the file name specified in the request (example: 54947df80e9e4471a2f99af509fb5889/myfile.nitf).

* For `read` operations, the File System Storage Provider reads the content file with the GUID specified in the ReadRequest.
* For `update` operations, the File System Storage Provider updates the content file with the content item's new InputStream contents. The GUID of the content file to be updated is included in the UpdateRequest.
* For `delete` operations, the File System Storage Provider deletes the content file with the GUID specified in the DeleteRequest.

[WARNING]
====
A sub-directory is created for each entry in the content store, so there will be limitations based on the file system that is used, i.e., the maximum amount of sub-directories supported for a file system.
====

==== Using

Use the File System Storage Provider if creating, reading, updating, and/or deleting contents in a file system is desired.

==== Installing and Uninstalling

The File System Storage Provider is packaged as the `content-core-filesystemstorageprovider` feature and can be installed and uninstalled using the normal processes described in the Configuration section. This feature is installed by default.

==== Configuring

The location used for content storage can be configured in the webconsole under 
Configuration -> Content File System Storage Provider.

==== Known Issues
None.

=== DDF Content REST CRUD Endpoint

The Content REST endpoint provides a CDR REST Retrieve v2.0-compliant DDF endpoint that allows clients to perform CRUD operations on the Content Repository using REST, a simple architectural style that performs communication using HTTP.

The URL exposing the REST functionality will be located at `http://<DDF_HOST>:<DDF_PORT>/services/content`, where `DDF_HOST` is the IP address of where DDF is installed and `DDF_PORT` is the port number on which DDF is listening.

The Content REST CRUD endpoint provides the capability to read, create, update, and delete content in the Content Repository, as well as create, update, and delete metacards in the catalog provider, i.e., the Metadata Catalog (MDC). Furthermore, this endpoint allows the client to perform the create/update/delete operations on just the Content Repository, just the MDC, or both in one operation.

[WARNING]
====
The Content Framework is currently transactional for create operations only. Therefore, the client sends a create request to create content in the DDF Content Repository, processes the content to create a metacard, and ingests it into the MDC (i.e.,directive=STORE_AND_PROCESS), If a problem is encountered during the catalog ingest, the content is removed from the DDF Content Repository, analogous to a rollback. This is so that the DDF Content Repository and the MDC are kept in sync.

The Content Framework does not support rollback capability for update or delete operations that affect both the DDF Content Repository and the MDC.
====

==== Using

The Content REST CRUD endpoint provides the capability to read, create, update, and delete content in the DDF Content Repository as well as create, update, and delete metacards in the catalog provider as follows. Sample requests and repsonses are provided in a separate table.

[TIP]
====
For all Content REST CRUD commands, only one content item ID is supported in the URL; i.e., bulk operations are not supported.

===== Interact with REST Endpoint

Any web browser can be used to perform a REST read. Various other tools and libraries can be used to perform the other HTTP operations on the REST endpoint (e.g., soapUI, cURL, etc.).

====== Create Request Multipart/Form-Data Parameters

The `create` (`HTTP POST`) request is a multipart/form-data request, allowing the binary data (i.e., the content) to be either included in the request's body or attached as a file. This binary data is defined in a `Content-Disposition` part of the request where the `name` parameter is set to `file`, and the optional `filename` parameter indicates the name of the file that the content should be stored as.

Optional form parameters for the `create` request are the `directive` and `contentUri`. The `directive` form parameter's value can be either`STORE`, `PROCESS`, or `STORE_AND_PROCESS`, indicating if the content should be only stored in the Content Repository, only processed to generate a metacard and then ingested into the MDC, or both. The `directive` form parameter will default to `STORE_AND_PROCESS` if it is not
specified. 

The `contentUri` form parameter allows the client to specify the URI of a product stored remotely/externally (relative to DDF). This `contentUri` is used to indicate that the client will manage the content storage but wants the Content Framework to parse the content and create/update/delete a catalog entry in the MDC using this content URI as the entry's product URI. This parameter is used when the `directive` is set to `PROCESS`.

====== Update and Delete Request HTTP Header Parameters

Two optional HTTP header parameters are available on the `update` and `delete` RESTful URLs.

The `directive` header parameter allows the client to optionally direct the Content Framework to:

* only store the content in the DDF Content Repository (`directive=STORE`)
* store the content in the repository and parse the content to create a metacard (`directive=STORE_AND_PROCESS`); this metacard is then created/updated/deleted in the Metadata Catalog (by invoking the Catalog Framework operations)

`STORE_AND_PROCESS` is the default value for the `directive` header parameter. The `directive` header parameter is only used on the `PUT` and `DELETE` RESTful URLs that have a `contentId` in the URL.

The `contentUri` header parameter allows the client to specify the URI of a product stored remotely/externally (relative to DDF). The `contentUri` header parameter is only used with the `PUT` and `DELETE` RESTful URLs, where the `contentId` is not appended to the URL.

====== Sample Requests and Responses

The table below displays sample REST requests and their responses for each of the operations supported by the Content REST endpoint.

For the examples below, DDF was running on host DDF_HOST on port DDF_PORT. Also, for all examples below the binary data, i.e., the "content", is not included in the request's body.

==== cURL Commands

The table below illustrates sample cURL commands corresponding to a few of the above REST requests. Pay special attention to the flags, as they vary between operations.

For these examples, DDF was running on host DDF_HOST on port DDF_PORT. We ingested/updated a file named geojson_valid.json whose MIME type was application/json;id=geojson, and whose content ID ended up being CONTENT_ID.

To perform each operation without using the catalog, replace `STORE_AND_PROCESS` with `STORE`. To manipulate the catalog entry only, replace `STORE_AND_PROCESS` with `PROCESS`.
