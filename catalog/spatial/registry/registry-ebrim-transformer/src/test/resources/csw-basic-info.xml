This Service example is meant to describe a single instance of a
node/repository/site for federation purposes. Two example ServiceBindings are
given as examples of "federation methods".
-->
<!--
The service id is the unique identfier for this instance. urn:service:catalog
describes what kind of a registry service entry this is. For federation purposes
all registry services that have objectType equal to urn:service:catalog will be
made available.
