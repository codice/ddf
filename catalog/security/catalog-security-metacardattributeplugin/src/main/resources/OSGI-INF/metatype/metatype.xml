            For example: source_attribute1=destination_attribute.
            The plugin gathers the source attributes that have a common destination.
            It takes the combined values of the source attributes and makes them the values of
            a (new) metacard attribute, the destination attribute.
            The strategy for combining the values is intersection, which means only the
            values common to all source attribute are added to the destination attribute.
            Note: Do not use the same destination attributes in both the Intersect and Union
            rule sets. The plugin will behave unpredictably."
