/**
 * {@code FilterAdapter} visits a {@link Filter} and invokes {@link FilterDelegate} methods with
 * normalized, typed values. A large part of implementing a {@link org.opengis.filter.FilterVisitor} is handling
 * expressions, type casting literals, and supporting custom filter logic like {@code FuzzyFunction}
 * s. The {@code FilterAdapter} handles all of this common boilerplate functionality. Furthermore,
 * sources using the {@code FilterAdapter} will receive future enhancements and ensure basic
 * compatibility with Endpoints that use the {@code FilterBuilder}.
 * <p>
 * To use the {@code FilterAdapter}, a {@code FilterDelegate} for the source is required. Here is an
 * example using a text base filter delegate.
 *
 * <pre>
 * FilterDelegate&lt;String&gt; delegate = new FilterToTextDelegate();
 *
 * FilterAdapter adapter = new FilterAdapterImpl();
 *
 * String result = adapter.adapt(filter, delegate);
 * </pre>
 *
 * A reference implementation is provided with the DDF Core in the Filter Proxy bundle.
