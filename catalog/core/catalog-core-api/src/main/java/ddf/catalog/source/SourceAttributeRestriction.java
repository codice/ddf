 * either be modified to maintain stability, lock up the source for undefined periods of time, or
 * fail outright. Not implementing this interface, or implementing but returning an empty set,

 *   <li>Supports any attribute available to the system, or
 *   <li>can gracefully handle or safely ignore undesireable attributes in a query without
 *       introducing usability problems such as degraded service or contradictions in the result
 *       set.

 *
 * <p><b>This interface should only be implemented by sources.</b> Information returned from this
 * interface will be exposed over the network to support validation scenarios prior to submitting a
