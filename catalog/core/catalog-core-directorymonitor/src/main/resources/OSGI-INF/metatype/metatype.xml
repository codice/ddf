This interval is used for sleeping between attempts to acquire the read lock on a file to be ingested.  The interval should be dependent on the speed of the copy to the directory monitor  (ex. network drive vs local disk).  For local files, the default value of 500 milliseconds is recommended. The recommended interval for network drives is 1000 - 2000 milliseconds.  If the value provided is less than 100, 100 milliseconds will be used."
