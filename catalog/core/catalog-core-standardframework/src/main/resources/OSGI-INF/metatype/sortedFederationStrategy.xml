    This metatype resides in the standard catalog framework instead of in the SortedFederationStrategy bundle because standard catalog framework creates
    SortedFederationStrategy and uses the (executor) pool singleton from SortedFederationStrategy across a few of its instantiated implementations.
    This metatype may go away once a smarter federation strategy is implemented.

        in conjunction with several federated sources could yield a large result set, which the sorted federation strategy has a limited ability to do.  
        The admin can make a rough calculation to decide what maximum start index to use based on the amount of memory in the system, the amount of 
        federated sources, the number of threads, and the expected amount of query results requested 
        ( (average # of threads) * (maximum # of federated sources) * (maxStartIndex + maximumQueryResults) ) must fit into the allocated memory of 
        the running distribution.  This field will be removed when sorted federation strategy has the ability to sort a larger amount of results."/>
