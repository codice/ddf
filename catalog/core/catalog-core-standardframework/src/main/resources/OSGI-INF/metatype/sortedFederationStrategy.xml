    <!--This metatype resides in the standard catalog framework instead of in the SortedFederationStrategy bundle
    because standard catalog framework creates SortedFederationStrategy and uses the (executor) pool singleton from
    SortedFederationStrategy across a few of its instantiated implementations. This metatype may go away once a smarter
    federation strategy is implemented.-->

            federated source. A large start index in conjunction with several federated sources could yield a large
            result set, which the sorted federation strategy has a limited ability to do. The admin can make a rough
            calculation to decide what maximum start index to use based on the amount of memory in the system, the
            amount of federated sources, the number of threads, and the expected amount of query results requested
            ( (average # of threads) * (maximum # of federated sources) * (maxStartIndex + maximumQueryResults) ) must
            fit into the allocated memory of the running distribution. This field will be removed when sorted federation
            strategy has the ability to sort a larger amount of results."/>
