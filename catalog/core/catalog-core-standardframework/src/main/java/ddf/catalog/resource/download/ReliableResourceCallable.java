/**
 * ReliableResourceCallable is responsible for reading product data from its @InputStream and then writing that data
 * to a @FileBackedOutputStream (that will be concurrently read by a client), and optionally caching the product to 
 * the file system. It is a @Callable that is started via a @Future by the @ReliableResourceDownloadManager class.
 *
 * The client uses the @ReliableResourceInputStream to read from the @FileBackedOutputStream. 
 *
 * This class will read bytes in chunks (whose size is specified by the caller) until it either reaches the EOF or it 
 * is interrupted (either by an @IOException or the @CachedResource).
 *
 * If the @InputStream is read until the EOF, then a -1 is returned indicating the entire stream was read successfully. 
 * Otherwise, the number of bytes read thus far is returned so that the caller can react accordingly (e.g., reopen the 
 * product @InputStream and skip forward that many bytes already read).
