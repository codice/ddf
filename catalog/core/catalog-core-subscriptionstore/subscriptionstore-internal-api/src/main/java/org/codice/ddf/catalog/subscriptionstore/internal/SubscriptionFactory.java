/**
 * Provides a way for endpoints or other subscription providers to define the deserialization
 * semantics when new subscription metadata is received as a result of another node's processing.
 * Endpoints or other subscription providers should register their own implementation of this
 * interface with the OSGi Framework.
 *
 * <p>It is important that subscription providers guarantee that <b>if their services are up, their
 * factory is up</b>. This can be easily done by registering their factory in the same bundle as
 * their services. For example, consider the case of a REST endpoint. If an external client can use
 * the endpoint, then the OSGi Framework should have access to the factory.
 *
 * <p><b>This interface is for internal use only and should not be implemented by a third party.
 * </b> <i>This code is experimental. While this interface is functional and tested, it may change
 * or be removed in a future version of the library.</i>
