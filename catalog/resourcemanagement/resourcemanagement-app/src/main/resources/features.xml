     NOTE: This features XML file uses the Karaf "install" attribute to specify whether a feature
     is automatically installed when an app's KAR file is hot deployed.

     Description of the install attribute from the Karaf features XSD:

     "Installation mode. Can be either manual or auto. Specifies whether the feature should be
     automatically installed when dropped inside the deploy folder. Note: This attribute doesn't
     affect feature descriptors that are installed from the command line or as part of the
     org.apache.karaf.features.cfg."
