## Development with Webpack Dev Server

###Building
You can use the webpack dev server for rapid development without having to build with Maven and deploy bundles for every change.

* Install package.json with `npm`

```
yarn install
```
* Make sure an instance of `ddf` is running locally on port 8993

```
npm run startplus
```
* Opens the browser for you.

* Alternatively
```
npm start
```
* Open http://localhost:8080/ to test and debug.

Automated tests are executed as part of the maven build but it is also possible to manually run 
the tests.

####Headless
