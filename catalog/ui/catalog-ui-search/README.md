## Internal Documentation for the Intrigue Backend

This is internal documentation. Some of the data structures documented here are either subject to 
change or are not publicly exposed. 

### Spark Applications Overview

The Intrigue backend is comprised of multiple Spark applications. 
They represent logical groups of functions, exposed over REST, and are as follows: 
* Configuration Application - provides access to Intrigue's configuration as set by the system administrator
* Forms Application - provides access to custom search forms so users only work with fields they care about
* Metacard Application - provides various CRUD operations on metacards and their respective data such as
types, validation details, history, associations, subscriptions, and annotations; primarily designed to work 
with non-resource metacards such as workspaces
* Query Application - provides support for querying the catalog with CQL
* Feedback Application - allows users to submit feedback about queries

### CXF Endpoints

Some functionality is defined using JAX-RS instead of Spark. 
* Metacard Edit Endpoint - allows the updating of metacards

### Intrigue Data Expectations

#### Filters

Intrigue currently represents a filter using the tokens of CQL in a JSON object hierarchy. The
key fields on each terminal node in the hierarchy are: 
* `type` - name of the operation to perform as a upper-case string
* `property` - name of the property to operate on
* `value` - value of the property to operate on; it can be:
    * Primitive type (int, double, boolean, or string - float not supported)
    * Temporal data (a DateTime object) specified as a string in ISO 8601 format (GML time range not supported)
    * Spatial data as a WKT string

For nodes that are logical operations and contain other nodes, they forgo the `property` and `value`
fields in favor of a `filters` field, which is a list of nodes.

Examples of this data structure are included for reference.

### Application Details

#### Forms Application

Search forms are custom query interfaces created by the system or user that only show query controls 
that the user is interested in. They effectively hide the complexity of very large query filters while 
allowing a small set of values to be plugged into predetermined locations within the filter tree. Search
forms also support the notion of "detail level" which limits what attributes are rendered when viewing 
results. Search forms are powered by filter templates and detail levels are powered by attribute groups. 

##### Filter XML 2.0

Filter templates and attribute groups are persisted in the catalog as metacards. Attribute groups are
simple: they only specify a set of attribute descriptor names. Filter templates store the templated 
filter data as [Filter XML 2.0](http://schemas.opengis.net/filter/2.0/) and leverage functions to
act as a placeholder when user input is needed. 

Comprehensive examples can be found in `catalog-ui-search/src/test/resources/forms/filter2` for reference. 
They are arranged by classification according to the bindings provided by `mvn:org.jvnet.ogc/filter-v_2_0/2.6.1`
which scrutinize by the number of parameters needed to construct a given JAXB type and the possible values
that can exist on a JAXB type (i.e. serializable literals vs more XML). 

Some operation types have incomplete examples. The instances of these types are listed here for reference. 

##### Spatial Binary Ops

Spatial Ops are supported by templates **only** when defined using functions for passthrough to user
input. GML cannot yet be used to specify constant location data on a template that's hidden away from
the user. 

Currently only `Intersects` and `Disjoint` are supported by Intrigue (from Filter 1.1):

`Intersects` - Tests whether two geometries intersect (example provided)
`Disjoint` - Tests whether two geometries are disjoint (example provided)

Unsupported: 

`Contains` - Tests whether a geometry contains another one
`Within` - Tests whether a geometry is within another one
`Touches` - Tests whether two geometries touch
`Crosses` - Tests whether two geometries cross
`Overlaps` - Tests whether two geometries overlap
`Equals` - Tests whether two geometries are topologically equal

##### Temporal Ops

Temporal Ops are **not yet supported** by templates for any use case. 

Currently only `After` and `Before` are supported by Intrigue (from Filter 1.1):

 `After` - tests whether a time instant occurs _after_ another
 `Before` - tests whether a time instant occurs _before_ another
 
 Unsupported: 
 
 ```
 TEquals (example provided)
 Begins
 BegunBy
 TContains
 During
 EndedBy
 Ends
 Meets
 MetBy
 TOverlaps
 OverlapedBy
 AnyInteracts
 ```
 
 Also note that Filter 2.0 adds complex temporal value support via GML, as shown in `temporal-ops/gml`
 vs the simple style shown in `temporal-ops/literal`.
