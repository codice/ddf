/**
 * The traditional {@link ddf.catalog.filter.FilterBuilder} interface allows the construction of
 * Filter 1.1 compliant data through a fluent-API, consisting of multiple interfaces, which provide
 * compile-time validation of the built data.
 *
 * <p>For using the builder in a visitor pattern, this approach can be cumbersome, and requires the
 * caching of various APIs since the data isn't known until it is visited. The {@link
 * FlatFilterBuilder} API allows any element to be built from the top level interface at the cost of
 * compile-time safety. Incorrect use of a {@link FlatFilterBuilder} is reported at runtime using
 * {@link IllegalStateException}s.
 *
 * <p>{@link FlatFilterBuilder}s are only used once, then discarded. Once {@link #getResult()} is
 * invoked, no more builder methods can be invoked. {@link #getResult()} can be called multiple
 * times without issue, but no further mutation of the data structure is permitted.
 *
 * <p>New implementations of {@link FlatFilterBuilder} should register themselves as part of the
 * parameterized {@code FlatFilterBuilderTest} to ensure the implementation conforms.
 *
 * @param <T> the object type to return upon which the filter is built.
