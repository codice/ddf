== Overview

The {branding} Standard Search UI application allows a user to search for records in the local
Catalog (provider) and federated sources. Results of the search are returned in HTML format and are
displayed on a globe, providing a visual representation of where the records were found.

Located at the bottom of the left pane of the Search UI are two tabs: <<Search>> and
<<Workspaces>>. The Search tab contains basic fields to query the Catalog and other sources. The
workspaces feature uses the same search criteria that are provided in the Search tab, and it also
allows the user to create custom searches that can be saved for later execution. The right-side
pane displays a map that, when records are found, shows the location of where the record was
retrieved.

== Search

The Standard Search UI allows users to search for records in the local Catalog and federated
sources based on the criteria entered in the Search tab. After a search is executed, the UI
provides results based on the defined criteria and detailed information about each result.
Additionally, a user can save individual records that were returned by the query to a workspace, so
they can be referenced in the future. The user can also save the search criteria to a workspace so
the query can be run again.

== Search Criteria

The Search UI queries a Catalog using the following criteria.

[cols="1,6", options="header"]

== Actions

Depending on the contents of the metacard, various actions will be available to perform on the
metadata.

Troubleshooting: if no actions are available, ensure IP address is configured correctly under
global configuration in Admin Console.

== Save a Search

Saved searches are search criteria that are created and saved by a user. Each saved search has a
name that was defined by the user, and the search can be executed at a later time or be scheduled
for execution. Saved records (metacards) that the user elected to save for future use are returned
as part of a search. These queries can be saved to a <<Workspaces, workspace>>, which is a
collection of searches and metacards created by a user. Complete the following procedure to create
a saved search.

. Select the Search tab at the bottom of the left pane.
. Use the fields provided to define the <<_search_criteria>> for the query to be saved.
. Select the *Save* button. The Select Workspace pane opens.
. Type a name for the query in the *ENTER NAME FOR SEARCH* field.
. Select a workspace in which to save the query, or create a workspace by typing a title for the
  new workspace in the *New Workspace* field.
  image:search-save.png[New workspace]

. Select the Save button.


[NOTE]
====
The size of the product is based on the value in the associated metacard's resource-size attribute.
This is defined when the metacard was originally created and may or may not be accurate. Often it
will be set to N/A, indicating that the size is unknown or not applicable.

However, if the administrator has enabled caching on {branding} and has installed the
catalog-core-resourcesizeplugin PostQuery Plugin, and if the product has been retrieved, it has
been cached and the size of the product can be determined based on the cached file's size.
Therefore, subsequent query results that include that product will display an accurate size under
the download link.
====

== Workspaces

Each user can create multiple workspaces and assign each of them a descriptive name. Each workspace
can contain multiple <<Save a Search, saved searches>> and contain multiple saved records
(metacards). Workspaces are saved for each user and are loaded when the user logs in. Workspaces
and their contents are persisted, so they survive if {branding} is restarted. Currently, workspaces
are private and cannot be viewed by other users.

=== Create a Workspace

. Select the Workspaces tab at the bottom of the Search UI's left pane. The Workspaces pane opens,
  which displays the existing workspaces that were created by the user. At the top of the pane, an
  option to *Add* and an option to *Edit* are displayed.
. Select the *Add* button at the top of the left pane. A new workspace is created.
. In the *Workspace Name* field, enter a descriptive name for the workspace.
  image:workspace-add.png[Enhanced Search]

. Select the *Add* button. The Workspaces pane opens, which now displays the new workspace and any
  existing workspaces.
. Select the name of the new workspace. The data (i.e., saved searches and records) for the
  selected workspace is displayed in the Workspace pane.
. Select the + icon near the top of the Workspace pane to begin adding queries to the workspace.
  The Add/Edit Search pane opens.
. Enter a name for the new query to be saved in the QUERY NAME field.
. Complete the rest of the <<_search_criteria>>.
  image:workspace-query.png[complete search criteria]

. Select the *Save & Search* button. The Search UI begins searching for records matching the
  criteria, and the new query is saved to the workspace. When the search is complete, the
  Workspace pane opens.
. Select the name of the search to view the query results.
  image:workspace-list.png[]
. If necessary, in the Workspace pane, select the *Edit* button then select the pencil
  (image:workspace-edit-search.png[]) icon next to the name of a query to change the search
  criteria.
. If necessary, in the Workspace pane, select the delete (image:workspace-remove-search.png[]) icon
  next to the name of a query to delete the query from the workspace.
  image:workspace-edit.png[]

== Notifications

The Standard Search UI receives all notifications from {branding}. These notifications appear as
pop-up windows inside the Search UI to alert the user of an event of interest. To view all
notifications, select the notification (image:notification-icon.png[Notification icon]) icon.

Currently, the notifications provide information about product retrieval only. After a user
initiates a resource download, they receive periodic notifications that provide the progress of the
download (e.g., the download completed, failed, or is being retried).

[NOTE]
====
A notification pop-up remains visible until it is dismissed or the browser is refreshed. Once a
notification is dismissed, it cannot be retrieved again.
====

== Activities

Similar to notifications, activities appear as pop-up windows inside the Search UI. Activity events
include the status and progress of actions that are being performed by the user, such as searches
and downloads. To view all activities, select the activity (image:notification-icon.png[]) icon in
the top-right corner of the window. A list of all activities opens in a drop-down menu, from which
activities can be read and deleted. If a download activity is being performed, the Activity
drop-down menu provides the link to retrieve the product.

If caching is enabled, a progress bar is displayed in the Activity (Product Retrieval) drop-down
menu until the action being performed is complete.

== Downloads

Downloads from the UI are currently managed by the user-specific browser's download manager.
The UI itself does not have a built-in download manager utility.

== Maps

The right side of the Search UI contains a map to locate search results on. There are three views
for this map, 3D, 2D, and Columbus View. To choose a different view, select the map icon in the
upper right corner. (The icon will change depending on current view selected: 3D
(image:3d-map-icon.png[]), 2D (image:2d-map-icon.png[]), Columbus (image:columbus-map-icon.png[])
