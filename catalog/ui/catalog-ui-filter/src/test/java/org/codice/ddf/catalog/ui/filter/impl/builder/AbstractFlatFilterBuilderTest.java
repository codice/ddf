/**
 * Conformance test suite for implementations of {@link
 * org.codice.ddf.catalog.ui.filter.FlatFilterBuilder}s to ensure their states are being managed
 * correctly. This test suite validates correct use, not necessarily expected results. For expected
 * results, defer to the unit tests of a particular implementation.
 *
 * <p>The test names follow a simple convention: {@code (context) + (builder method) + (validation
 * method or meaningful commentary)}. There are several contexts currently in use.
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Failure Condition - these map directly to the validation methods found in builder impls
 *   <li>Input - ensure implementations validate input correctly, to the degree the contract states
 *   <li>Awkward Case - misc tests that don't map to validation methods but are still useful, if not
 *       immediately obvious
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Most of the time, test names clearly define a mapping between builder function and the
 * verification that occurs behind the scenes. Refer to the state checks found in the builder
 * implementations.
