/**
 * {@link NodeReducer}s are {@link Function}s that take a {@link List} of filter nodes and reduce
 * them down to a single filter node. This paradigm is recurring throughout the entire filter data
 * structure:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A single binary logic node consists of a list of child nodes
 *   <li>Most terminal filters consist of a list of two expressions
 *   <li>Function nodes consist of an arbitrary number of arguments
 * </ul>
 *
 * This marker interface makes recognizing these key relationships much easier.
 *
 * @param <T> the type being used to represent a node in the filter tree.
