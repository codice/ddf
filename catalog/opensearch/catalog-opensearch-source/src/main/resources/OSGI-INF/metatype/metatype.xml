    <!--
        Due to documented bug in Apache Felix (FELIX-1865) where 2 configurations are listed in web admin console by the metatype
        mechanism, one with the Designate PID and its properties (correct) and the other with the OCD PID and no properties (incorrect).
        This bug has been fixed in Apache Felix web-console v3.1.10, but Karaf v2.2.1 still uses Felix web-console 3.1.8.
        Documented workaround is that Designate pid, factoryPid, ocdref, and OCD id must all be exactly the same. This is the fix
        DDF uses and it seems to work.
