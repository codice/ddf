#### Notes on Review Process
For the general case, merging is gated on the following:

* Review by at least two contributors
* Review by at least two committers
* Successful CI
* Successful static analysis (SonarQube/Coverity/etc.)
* Heroing of change (details vary by ticket)

Certain exceptions may occur. For example, if there is a problem with the CI environment then a manually performed full build and static analysis check may be substituted _at the discretion of the repository maintainers_. Additionally, repository metadata such as this `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE`, the repository `README`, and other non-functional items may be merged without requiring CI and static analysis.

Finally, an abbreviated review process may be in place for forward-port tickets immediately following branching and prior to branch divergence. In that case, approvals, CI, static analysis, and heroing that occur against the PR against the _release branch_ can be considered sufficient for reviewing the PR against the _master branch_.

Once the branches diverge, the process will return to normal.

Insofar as divergence is not a function of time but of change to the parent branch, the repository maintainers will determine when abbreviated review ends.

When abbreviated review is in effect, a note to that effect will be at the top of this template. Following is an example note:
```
