/**
 * Simpler helper class for XPath searches. Use with the XmlDocument helper class.

 * <p>The purpose is to reduce the amount of duplicated code used in the test classes.
 *
 * <p>This class is not thread-safe. It not optimized-- it creates new factories and builders for
 * every invocation. It is not suitable for use in production code.
 *
 * <p>This class does not catch errors. It passes errors up the call chain to provide developers
 * with the most information possible when debugging test cases.
 *
 * <p>For XML related test assertions, use an org.custommonkey.xmlunit.XMLAssert methods like
 * assertXpathEvaluatesTo().
 *
 * <p>For XML related test assertions in REST Assured responses, use the Hamcrest matcher method
 * hasXpath().
