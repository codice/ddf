// Double forward slashes "//" indicate comments and have no effect on policies.

// This policy file's intended usage is to contain appropriate sections for adding permissions related
// to configurations. For example, the Content Directory Monitor requires read/write permissions to
// the directory being monitored, and has an appropriate section below. Sections should contain
// sufficient details about adding permissions required for the given configuration.

// Instructions in this file may be duplicated in the documentation. Documentation provides better
// formatting and readability.

// When adding permissions for directories, trailing slashes have no effect on the permissions granted.
// For example, adding a permission for "/test/path" and "/test/path/" are equivalent. The recursive forms
// "/test/path${/}-", and "/test/path/${/}-" are also equivalent.

// IMPORTANT! - Adding new permissions requires a system restart to take affect.


//                        Content Directory Monitor (CDM) Permissions
// Adding required permissions for a new Content Directory Monitor.
//
// If monitoring a WebDav server, then adding these permissions is not required and these instructions can be ignored.
//
// Configuring CDM requires adding read and write permissions to the directory being monitored. For
// each configured CDM, the following 2 permissions are required:
//   1. permission java.io.FilePermission "<DIRECTORY_PATH>", "read";
//   2. permission java.io.FilePermission "<DIRECTORY_PATH>${/}-", "read, write";
// Replacing <DIRECTORY_PATH> with the path of the directory being monitored.
//
// Line 1 gives the CDM the permissions to read from the monitored directory path. Line 2 gives the
// CDM the permissions to recursively read and write from the monitored directory path, specified
// by the directory path's suffix "${/}-".
//
// If a CDM configuration is deleted, then the corresponding permissions that were added should be
// deleted to avoid granting unnecessary permissions to parts of the system.

// Adding required permissions for the URL Resource Reader to retrieve file resources.
//
//

// This is an example of how to give the URL Resource Reader permission to access a directory and everything it contains.

//                       Security-Hardening: Backup Log File Permissions
//  Adding required permissions to the logger for read and write access to modified backup log files
//
//  If you want to change the default location of the backup security log files, add a new permission
//  allowing the logger to create and modify the files within the new directory.
//  If you haven't already done so, follow the Enabling Fallback Audit Logging steps in the security hardening
//  checklist to finish configuring backup logging
