Welcome to Distributed Data Framework (DDF)
============================================
Distributed Data Framework (DDF) is an agile and modular integration framework. 

The following benefits are provided:
  * Standardization
    - Building on established Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and open standards avoids vendor lock-in
  * Extensibility
    - Capabilities can be extended by developing and sharing new features
  * Flexibility
    - Only features required can be deployed
  * Simplicity of installation and operation
    - Unzip and run
    - Configuration via a Web console
  * Simplicity of Development
    - Build simple Java Objects and wire them in via a choice of dependency injection frameworks
    - Make use of widely available documentation and components for DDF's underlying technologies
    - Modular development supports multi-organizational and multi-regional teams
  * Security
    - Web Service Security (WSS) functionality that comes with DDF is integrated throughout the system
    - Provides a Security Framework (a set of APIs that define the integration with the DDF framework)
    - Provides Security Service reference implementations for a realistic end-to-end use case.
