                Since DDF pulls in equinox 3.13.0 instead of what Karaf uses, R7 is available
                and felix.scr tries to use R7 logging even though the current version of pax-logging
                does not support it. This override can be removed when pax-logging supports R7
                (support was added in v2.0.1. See https://ops4j1.jira.com/browse/PAXLOGGING-255). -->
