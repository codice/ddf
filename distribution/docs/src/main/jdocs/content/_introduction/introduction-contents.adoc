=== Introducing ${ddf-branding}

*${ddf-branding-expanded}* (*${ddf-branding}*) is a free and open-source common data layer that abstracts services and business logic from underlying data structures to enable rapid integration of new data sources.

Licensed under http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html[LGPL], ${ddf-branding} is an interoperability platform that provides secure and scalable discovery and retrieval from a wide array of disparate sources.

${ddf-branding} is:

* a flexible and modular integration framework.
* built to "unzip and run" even when scaled to large enterprise systems.
* primarily focused on data integration, enabling clients to insert, query, and transform information from disparate data sources via the ${ddf-branding} Catalog.
