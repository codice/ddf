${branding} is comprised of several modular applications, to be installed or uninstalled as needed.

${ddf-admin} Application::
Enhances administrative capabilities when installing and managing ${branding}. It contains various services and interfaces that allow administrators more control over their systems.

${ddf-catalog} Application::
Provides a framework for storing, searching, processing, and transforming information.
Clients typically perform local and/or federated query, create, read, update, and delete (QCRUD) operations against the Catalog.
At the core of the Catalog functionality is the *Catalog Framework*, which routes all requests and responses through the system, invoking additional processing per the system configuration.

${ddf-platform} Application::
The Core application of the distribution.
The Platform application contains the fundamental building blocks to run the distribution.

${ddf-security} Application::
Provides authentication, authorization, and auditing services for the ${branding}.
It is both a framework that developers and integrators can extend and a reference implementation that meets security requirements.

${ddf-solr} Application::
Includes the Solr Catalog Provider, an implementation of the Catalog Provider using http://lucene.apache.org/solr/[Apache Solr] as a data store.

${ddf-spatial} Application::
Provides OGC services, such as http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/cat[CSW], http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcs[WCS], http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs[WFS], and http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/kml[KML].

${ddf-ui}::
Allows a user to search for records in the local Catalog (provider) and federated sources.
Results of the search are returned and displayed on a globe or map, providing a visual representation of where the records were found.
