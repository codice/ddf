==== Configuring the Product Cache from the ${admin-console}

All caching properties are part of the <<ddf.catalog.resource.download.ReliableResourceDownloadManager,Resource Download Settings>>.

===== Invalidating the Product Cache

. The product cache directory can be administratively invalidated by turning off the product caching using the Enable Product Caching configuration.
. Alternatively, an administrator may manually invalidate products by removing them from the file system. Products are cached at the directory specified in the Product Cache Directory configuration.

Format:

`<INSTALL-DIR>/data/product-cache/<source-id>-<metacard-id>`

Example:

`<INSTALL-DIR>/data/product-cache/abc123`

See <<_metacard_ingest_network_plugin, Metacard Ingest Network Plugin>>.
