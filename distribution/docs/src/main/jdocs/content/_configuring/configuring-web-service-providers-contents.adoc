==== Configuring Web Service Providers

By default Solr, STS server, STS client and the rest of the services use the system property `org.codice.ddf.system.hostname` which is defaulted to 'localhost' and not to the fully qualified domain name of the ${branding} instance.
Assuming the ${branding} instance is providing these services, the configuration must be updated to use the *fully qualified domain name* as the service provider.

This can be changed during <<_completing_installation_from_the_admin_console,Initial Configuration>> or later by editing the `<INSTALL_HOME>/etc/system.properties` file.
