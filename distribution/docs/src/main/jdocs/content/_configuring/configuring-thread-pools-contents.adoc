==== Configuring Thread Pools

The `org.codice.ddf.system.threadPoolSize` property can be used to specify the size of thread pools used by:

* Federating requests between ${branding} systems
* Downloading resources
* Handling asynchronous queries, such as queries from the UI

By default, this value is set to 128.
It is not recommended to set this value extremely high.
If unsure, leave this setting at its default value of 128.
