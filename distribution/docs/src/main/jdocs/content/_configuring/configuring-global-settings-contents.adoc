==== Configuring Global Settings with system.properties

Global configuration settings are configured via the properties file `system.properties`.
These properties can be manually set by editing this file or set via the initial configuration from the ${admin-console}.

[NOTE]
====
Any changes made to this file require a restart of the system to take effect.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
The passwords configured in this section reflect the passwords used to decrypt JKS (Java KeyStore) files.
Changing these values without also changing the passwords of the JKS causes undesirable behavior.

These properties are available to be used as variable parameters in input url fields within the ${admin-console}.
For example, the url for the local csw service (\${secure_url}/services/csw) could be defined as:

[source]
----
${variable-prefix}org.codice.ddf.system.protocol}${variable-prefix}org.codice.ddf.system.hostname}:${variable-prefix}org.codice.ddf.system.port}${variable-prefix}org.codice.ddf.system.rootContext}/csw
----

This variable version is more verbose, but will not need to be changed if the system `host`, `port` or `root` context changes.

[WARNING]
====
Only root can access ports < 1024 on Unix systems.
