==== Exporting Existing Configurations

.Exporting Existing Configurations from ${admin-console}
****
You can export the current system configurations using the ${admin-console}.
This is useful for migrating from one running instance to another or for installing a second node in a highly available deployment.

To export the current system configurations, follow these instructions:

. Select the *System* tab (next to the *Applications* tab)
+

. Click the *Export Configuration* button
+

. Fill out the form, specifying the _destination_ for the export. A relative path will be relative to `<${branding}_HOME>`.
+

. Click the *Start Export* button.
. If there are no warnings or errors, the form will automatically close upon finishing the export.

****

.Export Existing Configuration Settings from ${command-console}
****

To export the current ${branding} configuration from the ${command-console}:

. Type in `migration:export <directory>`. This command creates the exported configuration file `exported-${project.version}.zip` which is saved to the specified directory. If no directory is specified it will default to `<${branding}_HOME>/exported`

===== Troubleshooting Common Warnings or Failures of Configuration Export

If export is unsuccessful, use this list to verify the correct configuration.

* Export Destination Directory Permissions Set to Read Only.

.Insufficient Write Permissions

* Properties Set to Absolute File Paths
** Setting properties to absolute paths is not allowed; so update the property to a value that is relative to `<${branding}_HOME>`.
However, notice that the export did not completely fail, but issued a warning that a specific file was excluded.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Some system configuration files contain paths to other configuration files. For instance, the `system.properties` file contains the `javax.net.ssl.keyStore` property which provides the path to system key store.
The files referred to in the system configuration files will be included in the export process only if the path is relative to `<${branding}_HOME>`.
Using absolute paths and/or symbolic links in those cases will cause the `migration:export` command to display warnings about those files and exclude them from the export process.
The export process itself will not be aborted.
