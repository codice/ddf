:summary: Creating a custom catalog plugin.

Plugins extend the functionality of the Catalog Framework by performing actions at specified times during a transaction. 
Plugin interfaces are located in the Catalog Core API.
By implementing a plugin interface, actions can be performed at the desired time. 

[NOTE]
====
Catalog plugin interfaces are located in the catalog core API.
====

The following types of plugins can be created:

.Plugin Interfaces
[cols="1,2m,1,1", options="header"]
|===

|Plugin Type
|Plugin Interface
|Description
|Example

|Pre-Ingest
|ddf.catalog.plugin.PreIngestPlugin
|Runs before the Create/Update/Delete method is sent to the CatalogProvider
|Metadata validation services

|Post-Ingest
|ddf.catalog.plugin.PostIngestPlugin
|Runs after the Create/Update/Delete method is sent to the CatalogProvider
|EventProcessor for processing and publishing event notifications to subscribers

|Pre-Query
|ddf.catalog.plugin.PreQueryPlugin
|Runs prior to the Query/Read method being sent to the Source
|An example is not included with ${branding}

|Post-Query
|ddf.catalog.plugin.PostQueryPlugin
|Runs after results have been retrieved from the query but before they are posted to the Endpoint
|An example is not included with ${branding}

|Pre-Subscription
|ddf.catalog.plugin.PreSubscription
|Runs prior to a Subscription being created or updated
|Modify a query prior to creating a subscription

|Pre-Delivery
|ddf.catalog.plugin.PreDeliveryPlugin
|Runs prior to the delivery of a Metacard when an event is posted
|Inspect a metacard prior to delivering it to the Event Consumer

|Pre-Resource
|ddf.catalog.plugin.PreResource
|Runs prior to a Resource being retrieved
|An example is not included with ${branding}

|Post-Resource
|ddf.catalog.plugin.PostResource
|Runs after a Resource is retrieved, but before it is sent to the Endpoint
|Verification of a resource prior to returning to a client

|Policy
|ddf.catalog.plugin.PolicyPlugin
|Runs prior to all other catalog plugins to esablish the policy for requests/responses
|An example is MetacardValidityFilterPlugin

|Access
|ddf.catalog.plugin.AccessPlugin
|Runs directly after the PolicyPlugin
|An examples are the FilterPlugin and OperationPlugin

==== Implement Plugins

The procedure for implementing any of the plugins follows a similar format:

. Create a new class that implements the specified plugin interface.

. Implement the required methods.

. Create OSGi descriptor file to communicate with the OSGi registry.

.. Register plugin class as service to OSGi registry.

. Deploy to ${branding}.

.Plugin Performance Concerns
[NOTE]
====
Plugins should include a check to determine if requests are local or not. It is usually preferable to take no action on non-local requests.
====

[TIP]
====
Refer to the Javadoc for more information on all Requests and Responses in the `${ddf-branding-lowercase}.catalog.operation` and `${ddf-branding-lowercase}.catalog.event` packages.

===== Implementing Pre-Ingest Plugins

Develop a custom Pre-Ingest Plugin.

. Create a Java class that implements `PreIngestPlugin.` +
`public class SamplePreIngestPlugin implements ddf.catalog.plugin.PreIngestPlugin`
+
. Implement the required methods. +
 * `public CreateRequest process(CreateRequest input) throws PluginExecutionException, StopProcessingException;`
 * `public UpdateRequest process(UpdateRequest input) throws PluginExecutionException, StopProcessingException;`
 * `public DeleteRequest process(DeleteRequest input) throws PluginExecutionException, StopProcessingException;`
+
. Import the ${branding} interface packages to the bundle manifest (in addition to any other required packages). +
`Import-Package: ddf.catalog,ddf.catalog.plugin`
+
. Export the service to the OSGi registry. +
*Blueprint descriptor example*
`<service ref="[[SamplePreIngestPlugin ]]"interface="ddf.catalog.plugin.PreIngestPlugin" />`

====== Pre-Ingest Plugin Failure Behavior

In the event that this Catalog Plugin cannot operate but does not wish to fail the transaction, a `PluginExecutionException` will be thrown.
For any other Exceptions, the Catalog will "fail safe" and the Operation will be cancelled.
If processing is to be explicitly stopped, a `StopProcessingException` will be thrown.

====== Invoking Pre-Ingest Plugins

Pre-Ingest plugins are invoked serially, prioritized by descending OSGi service ranking. 
The plugin with the highest service ranking will be executed first. 

The output of a Pre-Ingest plugin is sent to the next Pre-Ingest plugin, until all have executed and the ingest operation is sent to the requested Source.

===== Implementing Post-Ingest Plugins

Develop a custom Post-Ingest Plugin.

. Create a Java class that implements `PostIngestPlugin`. +
`public class SamplePostIngestPlugin implements ddf.catalog.plugin.PostIngestPlugin`

 * `public CreateResponse process(CreateResponse input) *throws* PluginExecutionException;`
 * `public UpdateResponse process(UpdateResponse input) *throws* PluginExecutionException;`
 * `public DeleteResponse process(DeleteResponse input) *throws* PluginExecutionException;`

. Import the ${branding} interface packages to the bundle manifest (in addition to any other required packages). +
`Import-Package: ddf.catalog,ddf.catalog.plugin`

. Export the service to the OSGi registry. +
*Blueprint descriptor example*
`<service ref="[[SamplePostIngestPlugin ]]"interface="ddf.catalog.plugin.PostIngestPlugin" />`

====== Post-Ingest Plugin Failure Behavior

In the event that this Catalog Plugin cannot operate but does not wish to fail the transaction, a `PluginExecutionException` will be thrown.

====== Invoking Post-Ingest Plugins

Post-Ingest plugins are invoked serially in rank order.
