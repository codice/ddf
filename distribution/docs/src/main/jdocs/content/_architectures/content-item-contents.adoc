ContentItem is the domain object populated by the Storage Provider that represents the information about the content to be stored or content that has been stored in the Storage Provider.
A ContentItem encapsulates the content's globally unique ID, mime type, and input stream (i.e., the actual content).
The unique ID of a ContentItem will always correspond to a Metacard ID.
