:summary: Security PDP application.

The ${ddf-security} Policy Decision Point (PDP) module contains services that are able to perform authorization decisions based on configurations and policies.
In the ${ddf-security} Framework, these components are called realms, and they implement the `org.apache.shiro.realm.Realm` and `org.apache.shiro.authz.Authorizer` interfaces.
Although these components perform decisions on access control, enforcement of this decision is performed by components within theÂ notional PEP application.
