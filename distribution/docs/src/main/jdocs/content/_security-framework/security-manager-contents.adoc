`ddf.security.service.SecurityManager`

The Security Manager is a service that handles the creation of Subject objects.
A proxy to this service should be obtained by an endpoint to create a Subject and add it to the outgoing `QueryRequest`.
The Shiro framework relies on creating the subject by obtaining it from the current thread.
Due to the multi-threaded and stateless nature of the ${branding} framework, utilizing the Security Manager interface makes retrieving Subjects easier and safer.
