Policy plugins are invoked to set up the policy for a request/response.Â 
This provides an opportunity to attach custom requirements on operations or individual metacards.
All the 'requirements' from each Policy plugin will be combined into a single policy that will be included in the request/response.
Access plugins will be used to act on this combined policy.
