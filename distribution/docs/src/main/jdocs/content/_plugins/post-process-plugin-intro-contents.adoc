This code is experimental. While this interface is functional and tested, it may change or be removed in a future version of the library.

*Post-Process Plugins* are invoked after a metacard has been created, updated, or deleted and committed to the Catalog.
They are the last plugins to run and are triggered by a *Post-Ingest Plugin*.
Post-Process plugins are well-suited for asynchronous tasks.
See the <<_asynchronous_processing_framework, Asynchronous Processing Framework>> for more information about how *Post-Process Plugins* are used.
