:summary: Modifies metacards when created or ingested according to metacard validator services.

The Metacard Validity Marker Pre-Ingest plugin modifies the metacards contained in ``CreateRequest``s and ``UpdateRequest``s.

The plugin runs each metacard in the `CreateRequest` and `UpdateRequest` against each registered `MetacardValidator` service.

[NOTE]
====
This plugin can make it seem like ingested products are not successfully ingested if a user does not have permissions to access invalid metacards.
If an ingest did not fail, there are no errors in the ingest log, but the expected results do not show up after a query,
verify either that the ingested data is valid or that the <<_metacard_validity_filter_plugin,Metacard Validity Filter Plugin>> is configured to show warnings and/or errors.

===== Installing Metacard Validity Marker

This plugin is installed by default with a standard installation in the {ddf-catalog} application.

===== Configuring Metacard Validity Marker

By default, it will mark metacards with validation errors and warnings as they are reported by each metacard validator and then allow the ingest.
To prevent the ingest of certain invalid metacards, the `Metacard Validity Marker` plugin can be configured to "enforce" one or more validators.
Metacards that are invalid according to an "enforced" validator will not be ingested.

See <<ddf.catalog.metacard.validation.MetacardValidityMarkerPlugin,Metacard Validity Marker Plugin configurations>> for all possible configurations.

===== Using Metacard Validity Marker

Use this pre-ingest plugin to validate metacards against metacard validators, which can check schemas, schematron, or any other logic.Â
