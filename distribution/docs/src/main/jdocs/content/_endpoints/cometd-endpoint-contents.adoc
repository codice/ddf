:summary: Enables asynchronous search capabilities.
:implements: https://docs.cometd.org/current/reference/[CometD].

The http://cometd.org[CometD] endpoint enables asychronous search capabilties.
The CometD protocol is used to execute searches, retrieve results, and receive notifications.

For an example of using CometD within a webapp see: `distribution/sdk/sample-cometd/`

===== Installing CometD Endpoint

The CometD Endpoint is installed by default with a standard installation in the ${ddf-ui} application.

===== Configuring CometD Endpoint

The CometD endpoint has no configurable properties.

====== CometD Queries

Queries can be executed over CometD using the `/service/query` channel.
Query messages are JSON-formatted and use CQL alongside several other parameters.

.Query Parameters
[cols="1m,3,1", options="header"]
|===
|Parameter Name
|Description
|Required

|src
|Comma-delimited list of federated sites to search over
|No

|cql
|CQL query. See http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/cat[OpenGIS® Catalogue Services Specification] for more information about CQL.
|Yes

|sort
|Sort Type

The format for the sort options is `<Sort Field>:<Sort Order>`, where `<Sort Order>` can be either `asc` or `desc`.
|No

|id
|Query ID (Must be a unique ID, such as a UUID). This determines the channel that the query results will be returned on.
|Yes

|count
|Number of entries to return in the response. Default is 10.
|No

|start
|Specifies the number of the first result that should be returned.
|No

|timeout
|Time (in milliseconds) to wait for response.
|No

|===

Before a query is published the client should subscribe to the channel that will be passed in to the `id` field in order to receive query results once the query is executed.

For example if the following id was generated `3b19bc9c-2155-4ca6-bae8-65a9c8e373f6`, the client should subscribe to `/3b19bc9c-2155-4ca6-bae8-65a9c8e373f6`

Then the following example query could be executed:

.`/service/query`
[source,json]
----
{
  "src": "${branding-lowercase}.distribution",
  "cql":"(\"anyText\" ILIKE 'foo')",
  "id":"3b19bc9c-2155-4ca6-bae8-65a9c8e373f6",
  "sort":"asc"
}
----

This would return any results matching the text `foo` on the `/3b19bc9c-2155-4ca6-bae8-65a9c8e373f6` channel

====== Query Response Channel

The query responses are returned on the `/<id>` channel, which should be subscribed to in order to retrieve the results.
Replace `<id>` with the id that was used in the request.
The <<_cometd_notifications, Subscribing to Notifications>> section details how to subscribe to a CometD channel.

The response is returned as a data map that contains an internal map with the following keys:

====== CometD Notifications

Notifications are messages that are sent to clients to inform them of some significant event happening.
Clients must subscribe to a notification channel to receive these messages.

Notifications are published by the server on several notification channels depending on the type.

* subscribing to `/${branding-lowercase}/notifications/**` will cause the client to receive all notifications.
* subscribing to `/${branding-lowercase}/notifications/catalog/downloads` will cause the client to only receive notifications of downloads.

====== Using CometD Notifications

[NOTE]
====
The ${branding} Search UI serves as a reference implementation of how clients can use notifications.
====

Notifications are currently being utilized in the Catalog application for resource retrieval.
When a user initiates a resource retrieval, the channel `/ddf/notification/catalog/downloads` is opened, where notifications indicating the progress of that resource download are sent.
Any client interested in receiving these progress notifications must subscribe to that channel.

${branding} starts downloading the resource to the client that requested it, a notification with a status of "Started" will be broadcast.
If the resource download fails, a notification with a status of "Failed" will be broadcast.
Or, if the resource download is being attempted again after a failure, "Retry" will be broadcast.
When a notification is received, ${branding} Search UI displays a popup containing the contents of the notification, so a user is made aware of how their downloads are proceeding.
Behind the scenes, the ${branding} Search UI invokes the REST endpoint to retrieve a resource.

In this request, it adds the query parameter "user" with the CometD session ID or the unique User ID as the value.
This allows the CometD server to know which subscriber is interested in the notification.
For example, `${secure_url}/services/catalog/sources/${branding-lowercase}.distribution/2f5db9e5131444279a1293c541c106cd?
  transform=resource&user=1w1qlo79j6tscii19jszwp9s2i55` notifications contain the following information:

.[[_notification_contents]]Notification Contents
[cols="1m,3,1" options="header"]
|===
|Property Name
|Description
|Always Included with Notification

|application
|Name of the application that caused the notification to be sent.
|Yes

|id
|ID of the notification "thread" – Notifications about the same event should use the same id to allow clients to filter out notifications that may be outdated.
|Yes

|title
|Resource/file name for resource retrieval.
|Yes

|message
|Human-readable message containing status details.
|Yes

|timestamp
|Timestamp in milliseconds when notification was sent.
|Yes

|session
|CometD Session ID or unique User ID.
|Yes

|===

.Example: Notification Message
[source,json,linenums]
----
"data": {
	"application": "Downloads",
	"title": "Product retrieval successful",
	"message": "The requested product was retrieved successfully
		and is available for download.",
	"id": "27ec3222af1144ff827a351b1962a236",
	"timestamp": "1403734355420",
	"user": "admin"
}
----

====== Receive Notifications

* If interested in retrieve resource notifications, a client must subscribe to the CometD channel `/ddf/notification/catalog/downloads`.
* If interested in all notification types, a client must subscribe to the CometD channel `/ddf/notification/**`
* A client will only receive notifications for resources they have requested.
* Standard UI is subscribed to all notifications of interest to that user/browser session: `/ddf/notification/**`
* See <<_notification_contents,Notification Contents>> for the data that a notification contains.

====== Notification Events

Notifications are messages sent to clients to inform them of a significant event happening.
Clients must subscribe to a notification channel to receive these messages.

====== Persistence of Notifications

Notifications are persisted between sessions, however due to the nature of CometD communications, they will not be visible at first connection/subscription to ``/${ddf-branding-lowercase}/notifications/**``.

In order to retrieve notifications that were persisted or may have occurred since the previous session a client simply must publish an empty json message, `{}` to `/${ddf-branding-lowercase}/notifications`.
This will return all existing notifications to the user.

====== Notification Operations Channel

Notification Operations are commands that change the behavior of future notifications.
A notification operation is performed by publishing a list of commands to the CometD endpoint at `/notification/action`

.Operation Format
[cols="1m,2,1" options="header"]
|===
|Map Key
|Description
|Value Type

|action
|Type of action to request. +
If a client publishes with the `remove` action, it dismisses the notification and makes it unavailable again when notifications are retrieved. "remove" is currently only used action.
|String

|id
|ID of the notification to which the action relates
|String

|===

	"action": "remove",
 	"id": "27ec3222af1144ff827a351b1962a236"
} ]
----

====== Activity Events Channel

To receive all activity updates, follow the instructions at <<_cometd_notifications, Subscribing to Notifications>> and subscribe to `/ddf/activities/**`

Activity update messages follow a specific format when they are published to the activities channel.
These messages contain a data map that encapsulates the activity information.

|String

|operations
|Map of operations that can be performed on this activity. +
If the value is a URL, the client should invoke the URL as a result of the user invoking the activity operation.

If the value is not a URL, the client should send a message back to the server on the same topic with the operation name.

Note: the ${ddf-branding} UI will interpret several values with special icons: +

* `cancel` +
* `download` +
* `remove`

|JSON Map

|progress
