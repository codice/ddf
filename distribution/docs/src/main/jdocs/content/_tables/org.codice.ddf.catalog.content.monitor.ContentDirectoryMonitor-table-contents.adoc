|Description
|Default Value
|Required

|Directory Path
|monitoredDirectoryPath
|String
|"Specifies the directory to be monitored, can be a filesystem path or webdav address (only supported for Monitor in place)"
|false
|true

|Maximum Concurrent Files
|numThreads
|Integer
|Specifies the maximum number of concurrent files to be processed within a directory (maximum of 8).  If this number exceeds 8, 8 will be used in order to preserve system resources. Make sure that your system has enough memory to support the number of concurrent processing threads across all directory monitors.
|1
|true

|ReadLock Time Interval
|readLockIntervalMilliseconds
|Integer
|Specifies the time to wait (in milliseconds) before acquiring a lock on a file in the monitored directory.  This interval is used for sleeping between attempts to acquire the read lock on a file to be ingested.  The default value of 100 milliseconds is recommended.
|100
|true

|Processing Mechanism
|processingMechanism
|String
|Choose what happens to the content item after it is ingested. Delete will remove the original file after storing it in the content store. Move will store the item in the content store, and a copy under ./ingested, then remove the original file. (NOTE: this will double the amount of disk space used.) Monitor in place will index the file and serve it from its original location.
|in_place
|false

|Attribute Overrides
|attributeOverrides
|String
|Optional: Metacard attribute overrides (Key-Value pairs) that can be set on the content monitor. If an attribute is specified here, it will overwrite the metacard's attribute that was created from the content directory. The format should be 'key=value'. The maximum allowed size of an attribute override is 65,535 bytes.
