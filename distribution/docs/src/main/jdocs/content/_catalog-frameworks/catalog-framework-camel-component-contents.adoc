===== Sending Messages to Catalog Framework Endpoint

====== Catalog Framework Producer

In Producer mode, the component provides the ability to provide different inputs and have the Catalog framework perform different operations based upon the header values.  

For the CREATE and UPDATE operation, the message body can contain a list of metacards or a single metacard object. 

For the DELETE operation, the message body can contain a list of strings or a single string object.
The string objects represent the IDs of metacards to be deleted. 
The exchange's "in" message will be set with the affected metacards.
In the case of a CREATE, it will be updated with the created metacards.
In the case of the UPDATE, it will be updated with the updated metacards and with the DELETE it will contain the deleted metacards.
