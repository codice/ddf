==== ${branding} Data Migration

Data migration is the process of moving metadata from one catalog provider to another.
It is also the process of translating metadata from one format to another.Â 
Data migration is necessary when a user decides to use metadata from one catalog provider in another catalog provider.

The process for changing catalog providers involves first exporting the metadata from the original catalog provider and ingesting it into another.
