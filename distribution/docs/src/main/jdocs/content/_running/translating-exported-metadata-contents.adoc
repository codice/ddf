===== Translating Metadata from One Format to Another

Metadata can be converted from one data format to another format. 
Only the data format changes, but the content of the metadata does not, as long as `option -p` is used with the ingest command.
The process for converting metadata is performed by ingesting a data file into a catalog provider in one format and dumping it out into a file in another format.
