The ${branding} contains many tools to monitor system functionality, usage, and overall system health.

==== Metrics Reporting

Metrics are available in several formats and levels of detail.

Complete the following procedure now that several queries have been executed.

. Select *${ddf-platform}*
. Select *Metrics* tab
. For individual metrics, choose the format desired from the desired timeframe column:
.. PNG
.. CSV
.. XLS
. For a detailed report of all metrics, at the bottom of the page are selectors to choose time frame and summary level.
A report is generated in _xls_ format.

==== Managing Logging

The ${branding} supports a dynamic and customizable logging system including log level, log format, log output destinations, roll over, etc.

===== Configuring Logging

Edit the configuration file `<${branding}_HOME>/etc/org.ops4j.pax.logging.cfg]`

===== ${branding} log file

The name and location of the log file can be changed with the following setting:

`log4j.appender.out.file=<KARAF.DATA>/log/${branding-lowercase}.log`

===== Controlling log level

A useful way to debug and detect issues is to change the log level:

`log4j.rootLogger=DEBUG, out, osgi:VmLogAppender`

===== Controlling the size of the log file

Set the maximum size of the log file before it is rolled over by editing the value of this setting:

`log4j.appender.out.maxFileSize=20MB`

===== Number of backup log files to keep

Adjust the number of backup files to keep by editing the value of this setting:

`log4j.appender.out.maxBackupIndex=10`

===== Enabling logging of inbound and outbound SOAP messages for the ${branding} SOAP endpoints

By default, the ${branding} start scripts include a system property enabling logging of inbound and outbound SOAP messages.

`-Dcom.sun.xml.ws.transport.http.HttpAdapter.dump=true`

In order to see the messages in the log, one must set the logging level for `org.apache.cxf.services` to `INFO`. By default, the logging level for `org.apache.cxf` is set to `WARN`.

`${branding-lowercase}${at-symbol}local>log:set INFO org.apache.cxf.services`

===== Logging External Resources

Other appenders can be selected and configured.

For more detail on configuring the log file and what is logged to the console see: http://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest/#_log[Karaf Documentation: Log].

===== Enabling HTTP Access Logging

To enable access logs for the current ${branding}, do the following:

* Update the `jetty.xml` file located in `etc/` adding the following xml:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<Get name="handler">
    <Call name="addHandler">
      <Arg>
        <New class="org.eclipse.jetty.server.handler.RequestLogHandler">
          <Set name="requestLog">
            <New id="RequestLogImpl" class="org.eclipse.jetty.server.NCSARequestLog">
              <Arg><SystemProperty name="jetty.logs" default="data/log/"/>/yyyy_mm_dd.request.log</Arg>
              <Set name="retainDays">90</Set>
              <Set name="append">true</Set>
              <Set name="extended">false</Set>
              <Set name="LogTimeZone">GMT</Set>
            </New>
          </Set>
        </New>
      </Arg>
    </Call>
  </Get>
----

Change the location of the logs to the desired location. In the settings above, location will default to data/log (same place where the log is located).

The log is using _National Center for Supercomputing Association Applications (NCSA)_ or Common format (hence the class 'NCSARequestLog').
This is the most popular format for access logs and can be parsed by many web server analytics tools. Here is a sample output:

[source]
----
127.0.0.1 -  -  [14/Jan/2013:16:21:24 +0000] "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 200 0
127.0.0.1 -  -  [14/Jan/2013:16:21:33 +0000] "GET /services/ HTTP/1.1" 200 0

===== Using the LogViewer

Monitor system logs with the *LogViewer*, a convenient "viewing portal" for incoming logs.

* Navigate to the LogViewer at \${secure_url}/admin/logviewer

or

* Navigate to the ${admin-console}
* Navigate to the *System* tab
* Select *Logs*

The LogViewer displays the most recent 500 log messages by default, but will grow to a maximum of 5000 messages.
To view incoming logs, select the *PAUSED* button to toggle it to *LIVE* mode. Switching this back to *PAUSED* will prevent any new logs from being displayed in the LogViewer. Note that this only affects the logs displayed by the LogViewer and does not affect the underlying log.

Log events can be filtered by:

* Log level (`ERROR`, `WARNING`, etc).
** The LogViewer will display at the currently configured log level for the Karaf logs.
*** See <<controlling_log_level, Controlling Log Level>> to change log level.
* Log message text.
* Bundle generating the message.

[WARNING]
====
It is not recommended to use the LogViewer if the system logger is set to a low reporting level such as `TRACE`.
The volume of messages logged will exceed the polling rate, and incoming logs may be missed.

The actual logs being polled by the LogViewer can still be accessed at `<INSTALL_HOME>/data/log`
====

[NOTE]
====
The LogViewer settings don't change any of the underlying logging settings, only which messages are displayed.
It does not affect the logs generated or events captured by the system logger.
