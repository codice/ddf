:summary: Resolves file extensions to mime types and vice versa.

The MimeTypeMapper is the entry point in ${branding} for resolving file extensions to mime types, and vice versa.

`MimeTypeMappers` are used by the `ResourceReader` to determine the file extension for a given mime type in aid of retrieving a product.
`MimeTypeMappers` are also used by the `FileSystemProvider` in the Catalog Framework to read a file from the content file repository.

The `MimeTypeMapper` maintains a list of all of the `MimeTypeResolvers` in ${branding}.

The `MimeTypeMapper` accesses each `MimeTypeResolver` according to its priority until the provided file extension is successfully mapped to its corresponding mime type.
If no mapping is found for the file extension, `null` is returned for the mime type.
Similarly, the `MimeTypeMapper` accesses each `MimeTypeResolver` according to its priority until the provided mime type is successfully mapped to its corresponding file extension.
If no mapping is found for the mime type, `null` is returned for the file extension.

For files with no file extension, the MimeTypeMapper will attempt to determine the mime type from the contents of the file.
If it is unsuccessful, the file will be ingested as a binary file.
