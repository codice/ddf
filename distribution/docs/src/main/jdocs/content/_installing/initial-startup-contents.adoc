=== Initial Startup

Run the ${branding} using the appropriate script.

.*NIX
----
<${branding}_HOME>/bin/${branding-lowercase}
----

.Windows
----
<${branding}_HOME>/bin/${branding-lowercase}.bat
----

The distribution takes a few moments to load depending on the hardware configuration.

[TIP]
====
To run ${branding} as a service, see <<_starting_as_a_service,Starting as a Service>>.
====

==== Verifying Startup

At this point, ${branding} should be configured and running with a Solr Catalog Provider.
New features (endpoints, services, and sites) can be added as needed.

Verification is achieved by checking that all of the ${branding} bundles are in an *Active* state (excluding fragment bundles which remain in a *Resolved* state).

[NOTE]
====
It may take a few moments for all bundles to start so it may be necessary to wait a few minutes before verifying installation.
====

Execute the following command to display the status of all the ${branding} bundles:

.View Status
----
${branding-lowercase}${at-symbol}local>list | grep -i ${branding-lowercase}
----

[WARNING]
====
Entries in the *Resolved* state are expected, they are OSGi bundle fragments.
Bundle fragments are distinguished from other bundles in the command line console list by a field named `Hosts`, followed by a bundle number.
Bundle fragments remain in the *Resolved* state and can never move to the *Active* state.
====

.Example: Bundle Fragment in the Command Line Console
----
96 | Resolved |  80 | 2.10.0.SNAPSHOT | DDF :: Platform :: PaxWeb :: Jetty Config, Hosts: 90
----

After successfully completing these steps, the ${branding} is ready to be configured.
