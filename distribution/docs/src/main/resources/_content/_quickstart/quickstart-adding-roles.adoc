((({title})))

Users or user groups can be customized to enable or restrict access to specific certain system functions.
Define a custom role and assign it to users who need specific access.

For an example, limit the replication admin view to users with a `sr_analyst` role.

.Define a new role
. Navigate to the ${admin-console}.
. Navigate to the ${ddf-security} app.
. Navigate to the *Configuration* tab.
. Select the *Web Context Policy Manager* Configuration.
. Select *Required Attributes*.
. Define the contexts to be restricted.
.. Enter `<CONTEXT>={http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/role=<ROLE_NAME>`
... For example, enter `/admin/replication={http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/role=sr_analyst}`
... Select the *+* sign to add another required attribute.
... Enter `/admin/hub/graphql={http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/role=sr_analyst}`

.Assign the new role to users
. Add the new role (`sr_analyst`) to selected users in the `users.properties` file. Add the role to the line of each chosen user.
.. For example, `user1=password,sr_analyst`
. Restart Alliance to apply the changes.
.. `/app/bin/stop`
.. `/app/bin/start`

In the example given, the `/admin/replication` context is only accessible to users with the `sr_analyst` role.
Other roles can be designated as needed by substituting the `<CONTEXT>` and the `<ROLE_NAME>` as needed.
