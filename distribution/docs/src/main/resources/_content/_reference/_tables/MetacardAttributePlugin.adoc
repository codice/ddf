|Metacard Intersect Attributes:
|intersectMetacardAttributes
|List of rules
|Each line item in the configuration is a rule.
             The format of a rule is the name of a single source attribute,
             followed by an equals sign, followed by the destination attribute.
             For example: source_attribute1=destination_attribute.
             The plugin gathers the source attributes that have a common destination.
             It takes the combined values of the source attributes and makes them the values of
             a (new) metacard attribute, the destination attribute.
             The strategy for combining the values is intersection, which means only the
             values common to all source attribute are added to the destination attribute.
             Note: Do not use the same destination attributes in both the Intersect and Union
             rule sets. The plugin behaves unpredictably.

|Metacard Union Attributes:
|unionMetacardAttributes
|List of rules
|Each line item in the configuration is a rule.
             The format of a rule is the name of a single source attribute,
             followed by an equals sign, followed by the destination attribute.
             For example: source_attribute1=destination_attribute.
             The plugin gathers the source attributes that have a common destination.
             It takes the combined values of the source attributes and makes them the values of
             a (new) metacard attribute, the destination attribute.
             The strategy for combining the values is union, which means only all the values
             of the source attribute are added to the destination attribute (excluding duplicates)
             Note: Do not use the same destination attributes in both the Intersect and Union
             rule sets. The plugin behaves unpredictably.
