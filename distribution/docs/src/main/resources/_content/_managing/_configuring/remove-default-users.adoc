The default security configuration uses a property file located at `${home_directory}/etc/users.properties` to store users and passwords.
A hardened system removes this file and manage all users externally, via an LDAP server or by other means.
Refer to the Security documentation for Karaf ${karaf.version} at https://karaf.apache.org/documentation.html[Karaf documentation] {external-link} for more information.

Once ${branding} is configured to use an external user (such as LDAP), remove the `users.properties` file from the `${home_directory}/etc` directory.
Use of a `users.properties` file should be limited to emergency recovery operations and replaced as soon as effectively possible.
