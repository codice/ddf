Attribute Overriding is the act of replacing existing attribute values with a new value.

Note that the attribute must be part of the metacard's <<{integrating-prefix}metacard_type,Metacard Type>> before it can be overridden. +
See <<{managing-prefix}attributes_added_by_attribute_injection,Attributes Added By Attribute Injection>> for more information about injecting attributes into the metacard type.
