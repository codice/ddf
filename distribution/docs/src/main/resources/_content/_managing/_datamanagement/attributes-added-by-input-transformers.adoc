=== {title}

<<{architecture-prefix}available_input_transformers,Input Transformers>> create and populate metacards by parsing a resource.
See <<{metadata-prefix}file_format_specific_attributes,File Format Specific Attributes>> to see the attributes used for specific file formats.

{branding} chooses which input transformer to use by:

. Resolving the mimetype for the resource.
. Gathering all the input transformers associated with the resolved mimetype. See <<{metadata-prefix}all_file_formats_supported,Supported File Formats>> for a list of supported mimetypes.
. Iterating through the transformers until a successful transformation is performed.

The first transformer that can successfully create a metacard from the ingested resource is chosen.
If no transformer can successfully transform the resource, the ingest process fails.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Each of the ingest methods may have subtle differences when resolving the resource's mimetype/input transformer.
