((Policy plugins)) are invoked to set up the policy for a request/response.
This provides an opportunity to attach custom requirements on operations or individual metacards.
All the 'requirements' from each Policy plugin are combined into a single policy that is included in the request/response.
Access plugins are used to act on this combined policy.
