:summary: FilterBuilder API.

((({title})))
To avoid the complexities of working with the Filter interface directly and implementing the ${branding} Profile of the Filter specification, the ${ddf-catalog} includes an API, primarily in `${ddf-branding}.filter`, to build Filters using a fluent API.

To use the `FilterBuilder` API, an instance of `${ddf-branding}.filter.FilterBuilder` should be used via the OSGi registry.
Typically, this is injected via a dependency injection framework.
Once an instance of `FilterBuilder` is available, methods can be called to create and combine Filters.

[TIP]
====
The fluent API is best accessed using an IDE that supports code-completion.
For additional details, refer to the [Catalog API Javadoc].

== Boolean Operators

Filters use a number of boolean operators.

`FilterBuilder.allOf(Filter ...)`:: creates a new Filter that requires all provided Filters are satisfied (Boolean AND), either from a List or Array of Filter instances.

`FilterBuilder.anyOf(Filter ...)`:: creates a new Filter that requires at least one of the provided Filters are satisfied (Boolean OR), either from a List or Array of Filter instances.

`FilterBuilder.not(Filter filter)`:: creates a new Filter that requires the provided Filter must not match (Boolean NOT).

== Attribute

Filters can be based on specific attributes.

`FilterBuilder.attribute(String attributeName)`:: begins a fluent API for creating an Attribute-based Filter, which is a Filter that matches on Metacards with Attributes of a particular value.
