== Overview

Distributed Data Framework ({branding}) is an agile and modular integration framework.
It is primarily focused on data integration, enabling clients to insert, query and transform information from disparate data sources via the {branding} Catalog. A Catalog API allows integrators to insert new capabilities at various stages throughout each operation.
{branding} is designed with the following architectural qualities to benefit integrators.
