:summary: Modifies metacards when created or updated.

The Metacard Groomer Pre-Ingest plugin makes modifications to `CreateRequest` and `UpdateRequest` metacards.

Use this pre-ingest plugin as a convenience to apply basic rules for your metacards.Â 

This plugin makes the following modifications when metacards are in a `CreateRequest`:

* Overwrites the `Metacard.ID` field with a generated, unique, 32 character hexadecimal value if missing or if the resource URI is not a catalog resource URI.
* Sets `Metacard.CREATED` to the current time stamp if not already set.
* Sets `Metacard.MODIFIED` to the current time stamp if not already set.
* Sets `Core.METACARD_CREATED` to the current time stamp if not present.
* Sets `Core.METACARD_MODIFIED` to the current time stamp.

In an `UpdateRequest`, the same operations are performed as a `CreateRequest`, except:

* If no value is provided for `Metacard.ID` in the new metacard, it will be set using the `UpdateRequest` ID if applicable.
