Plugins are additional tools to use to add additional business logic at certain points, depending on the type of plugin.

The Catalog Framework calls Catalog Plugins to process requests and responses as they enter and leave the Framework. 

=== Types of Plugins

Plugins can be designed to run before or after certain processes.
They are often used for validation, optimization, or logging.
Many plugins are designed to be called at more than one time. See <<_catalog_plugin_compatibility,Catalog Plugin Compatibility>>.
