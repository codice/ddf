:summary: Source Metrics.

Metrics are also collected on a per source basis for each configured <<{managing-prefix}connecting_to_sources,Federated Source>> and <<{managing-prefix}catalog_providers,Catalog Provider>>.
When the source is configured, the metrics listed in the table below are automatically created.
Metrics are collected for each request(whether enterprise query or a source-specific query).
When the source is deleted (or renamed), the associated metrics' MBeans and Collectors are also deleted.
However, the RRD file in the `data/metrics` directory containing the collected metrics remain indefinitely and remain accessible from the *Metrics* tab in the ${admin-console}.

In the table below, the metric name is based on the Source's ID (indicated by `<sourceId>`).

|Metric

|Description

|Source <sourceId> Exceptions
|`${ddf-branding-lowercase}.metrics.catalog.source:name=<sourceId>.Exceptions`
|Count
|A count of the total number of exceptions, of all types, thrown from catalog queries executed on this source.

|Source <sourceId> Queries
|`${ddf-branding-lowercase}.metrics.catalog.source:name=<sourceId>.Queries`
|Count
|A count of the number of queries attempted on this source.

|Source <sourceId> Queries Total Results
|`${ddf-branding-lowercase}.metrics.catalog.source:name=<sourceId>.Queries.TotalResults`
|Mean
|An average of the total number of results returned from executed queries on this source.

This total results data is averaged over the metric's sample rate.

|===

For example, if a Federated Source was created with a name of `fs-1`, then the following metrics would be created for it: 

* `Source Fs1 Exceptions`
* `Source Fs1 Queries`
* `Source Fs1 Queries Total Results`

If this federated source is then renamed to `fs-1-rename`, the MBeans and Collectors for the `fs-1` metrics are deleted, and new MBeans and Collectors are created with the new names: 

* `Source Fs1 Rename Exceptions`
* `Source Fs1 Rename Queries`
* `Source Fs1 Rename Queries Total Results`

Note that the metrics with the previous name remain on the Metrics tab because the data collected while the Source had this name remains valid and thus needs to be accessible.
Therefore, it is possible to access metrics data for sources renamed months ago, i.e., until ${branding} is reinstalled or the metrics data is deleted from the `${home_directory}/data/metrics` directory.
Also note that the source metrics' names are modified to remove all non-alphanumeric characters and renamed in camelCase.
