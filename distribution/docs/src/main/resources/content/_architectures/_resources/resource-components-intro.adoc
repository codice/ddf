Resource components are used when working with resources

A resource is a URI-addressable entity that is represented by a metacard.

Resources may exist either locally or on a remote data store.

Examples of resources include:

* NITF image
* MPEG video
* Live video stream
* Audio recording
* Document

A resource object in ${branding} contains an `InputStream` with the binary data of the resource. 
It describes that resource with a name, which could be a file name, URI, or another identifier. 
It also contains a mime type or content type that a client can use to interpret the binary data.
