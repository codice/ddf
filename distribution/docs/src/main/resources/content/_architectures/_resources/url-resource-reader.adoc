:summary: URL Resource Reader.

The `URLResourceReader` is an implementation of `ResourceReader` which is included in the ${branding} Catalog. 
It obtains a resource given an http, https, or file-based URL. 
The `URLResourceReader` will connect to the provided Resource URL and read the resource's bytes into an `InputStream`.  

[WARNING]
====
When a resource linked using a file-based URL is in the product cache, the `URLResourceReader`&#8217;s rootResourceDirectories is not checked when downloading the product.
It is downloaded from the product cache which bypasses the `URLResourceReader`.
For example, if path `/my/valid/path` is configured in the `URLResourceReader`&#8217;s rootResourceDirectories and one downloads the product with resource-uri `file:///my/valid/path/product.txt` and then one removes `/my/valid/path` from the `URLResourceReader`&#8217;s `rootResourceDirectories` configuration, the product will still be accessible via the product cache.
====

===== Installing the URL Resource Reader

The `URLResourceReader` is installed by default with a standard installation in the ${ddf-catalog} application.

===== Configuring the URL Resource Reader

Configure the URL Resource Reader from the ${admin-console}.

. Navigate to the *${admin-console}*.
. Select the *${ddf-catalog}* application.
. Select the *Configuration* tab.
. Select the *URL Resource Reader*.

See <<{application-prefix}ddf.catalog.resource.impl.URLResourceReader,URL Resource Reader configurations>> for all possible configurations.

=== Configuring Permissions for the URL Resource Reader

Configuring the URL Resource Reader to retrieve files requires adding Security Manager read permission entries for the directory containing the resources. To add the correct permission entries, edit the file ${home_directory}/security/configurations.policy. In the URL Resource Reader section of the file, add two new permission for each top-level directory that the Resource Reader needs to access. The Resource Reader needs one permission to read the directory and another to read its contents.

.Adding New Permissions
[WARNING]
====
After adding permission entries, a system restart is required for them to take effect.
====

grant codeBase "file:/org.apache.tika.core/catalog-core-urlresourcereader" {
//# Add permissions here
permission java.io.FilePermission "<DIRECTORY_PATH>", "read";
permission java.io.FilePermission "<OTHER_DIRECTORY_PATH>", "read";
}

The first permission entry allows the URL Resource Reader to read the directory. The second permission entry allows the URL Resource Reader to recursively read the contents of the directory. 
The trailing slashes after <DIRECTORY_PATH> have no effect on the permissions granted. For example, adding a permission for "/test/path" and "/test/path/" are equivalent. The recursive forms "/test/path${/}-", and "/test/path/${/}-" are also equivalent.

==== Using the URL Resource Reader

`URLResourceReader` will be used by the Catalog Framework to obtain a resource whose metacard is cataloged in the local data store.
This particular `ResourceReader` will be chosen by the `CatalogFramework` if the requested resource's URL has a protocol of `http`, `https`, or `file`.  

For example, requesting a resource with the following URL will make the Catalog Framework invoke the `URLResourceReader` to retrieve the product.

.Example
[source,http]
----
file:///home/users/${ddf-branding}_user/data/example.txt
----

If a resource was requested with the URL `udp://123.45.67.89:80/SampleResourceStream`, the `URLResourceReader` would _not_ be invoked.

.Supported Schemes:
* http
* https
* file

[NOTE]
====
If a file-based URL is passed to the `URLResourceReader`, that file path needs to be accessible by the ${branding} instance.
