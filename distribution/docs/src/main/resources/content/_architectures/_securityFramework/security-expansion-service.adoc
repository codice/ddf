:summary: Expansion Service.

The Expansion Service and its corresponding expansion-related commands provide an easy way for developers to add expansion capabilities to ${branding} during user attribute and metadata card processing.
In addition to these two defined uses of the expansion service, developers are free to utilize the service in their own implementations.

Each instance of the expansion service consists of a collection of rulesets.
Each ruleset consists of a key value and its associated set of rules.
Callers of the expansion service provide a key and a value to be expanded.
The expansion service then looks up the set of rules for the specified key.
The expansion service cumulatively applies each of the rules in the set, starting with the original value.
The result is returned to the caller.

.Expansion Service Ruleset Format
[cols="1,2m,2m" options="header"]
|===

|Key (Attribute)
2+^|Rules (original -> new)

.3+^|key1
|value1
|replacement1

|value2
|replacement2

|value3
|replacement3

.2+^|key2
|value1
|replacement1

|value2
|replacement2

|===

The examples below use the following collection of rulesets:

.Expansion Service Example Ruleset
[cols="1,2m,2m" options="header"]
|===

|Key (Attribute)
2+^|Rules (original -> new)

.3+^|Location
|Goodyear
|Goodyear AZ

|AZ
|AZ USA

|CA
|CA USA

.2+^|Title
|VP-Sales
|VP-Sales VP Sales

|VP-Engineering
|VP-Engineering VP Engineering

|===

Note that the rules listed for each key are processed in order, so they may build upon each other, i.e., a new value from the new replacement string may be expanded by a subsequent rule.
In the example `Location:Goodyear` would expand to `Goodyear AZ USA` and `Title:VP-Sales` would expand to `VP-Sales VP Sales`.
