The ${ddf-security} STS Server is a bundle that starts up an implementation of the CXF STS.
The STS obtains many of its configurations (Claims Handlers, Token Validators, etc.) from the OSGi service registry as those items are registered as services using the CXF interfaces.
The various services that the STS Server imports are listed in the Implementation Details section of this page.

[NOTE]
====
The WSDL for the STS is located at the `security-sts-server/src/main/resources/META-INF/sts/wsdl/ws-trust-1.4-service.wsdl` within the source code.
