== {title}

This configuration works just like the STS Client Config for the internal STS, but produces standard requests instead of the custom ${branding} ones.
It supports two new auth types for the context policy manager, WSSBASIC and WSSPKI.
Use these auth types when connecting to a non-${branding} STS or if ignoring realms.

=== Security STS Address Provider

This allows one to select which STS address will be used (e.g. in SOAP sources) for clients of this service.
Default is off (internal).
