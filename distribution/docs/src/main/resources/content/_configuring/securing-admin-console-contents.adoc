==== Securing ${admin-console}

If you have integrated ${branding} with your existing security infrastructure, then you may want to limit access to parts of the ${branding} based on user roles/groups.

===== Restricting Access to ${admin-console}

* *{hardening-step}*

Limit access to the ${admin-console} to those users who need access.
To set access restrictions on the ${admin-console}, consult the organization's security architecture to identify specific realms, authentication methods, and roles required.

. Navigate to the *${admin-console}*.
. Select the *${ddf-security}* application.
. Select the *Configuration* tab.
. Select the *Web Context Policy Manager*.
.. A dialogue will pop up that allows you to edit ${branding} access restrictions.
.. Once you have configured your <<org.codice.ddf.security.policy.context.impl.PolicyManager,realms>> in your security infrastructure, you can associate them with ${branding} contexts.
.. If your infrastructure supports multiple <<org.codice.ddf.security.policy.context.impl.PolicyManager,authentication methods>>, they may be specified on a per-context basis.
.. Role requirements may be enforced by configuring the <<org.codice.ddf.security.policy.context.impl.PolicyManager,required attributes>> for a given context.
.. The <<org.codice.ddf.security.policy.context.impl.PolicyManager,white listed contexts>> allows child contexts to be excluded from the authentication constraints of their parents.

===== Restricting Feature, App, Service, and Configuration Access

* *{hardening-step}*

Limit access to the individual applications, features, or services to those users who need access.
Organizational requirements should dictate which applications are restricted and the extent to which they are restricted.

. Navigate to the *${admin-console}*.
. Select the *${ddf-admin}* application.
. Select the *Configuration* tab.
. Select the *Admin Configuration Policy*.
. To add a feature or app permission:
.. Add a new field to "Feature and App Permissions" in the format of:
+
`<feature name>/<app name> = "attribute name=attribute value","attribute name2=attribute value2", ...`
+
.. For example, to restrict access of any user without an admin role to the catalog-app:
+
`catalog-app = "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/role=admin", ...`
+
. To add a configuration permission:
.. Add a new field to "Configuration Permissions" in the format of:
+
`configuration id = "attribute name=attribute value","attribute name2=attribute value2", ...`
.. For example, to restrict access of any user without an admin role to the Web Context Policy Manager:
+
`org.codice.ddf.security.policy.context.impl.PolicyManager="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/role=admin"`

If a permission is specified, any user without the required attributes will be unable to see or modify the feature, app, or configuration.
