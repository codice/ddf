${branding} contains a set of features which allow it to use CAS as its Single Sign-On (SSO) service.
It communicates with a CAS server over the CAS Protocol v2 (see https://apereo.github.io/cas/5.2.x/protocol/CAS-Protocol-V2-Specification.html),
and has been tested to work with version 3.6.0 of the CAS server. However, it should integrate with
any 3.x server. The components which provide this support are listed below.

|Feature Name
|Description

|security-cas-client
|When a user makes a request to a context configured for CAS authentication, it is received by the
CAS client. The client redirects unauthenticated users to CAS, and validates their service tickets
after they authenticate.

|security-cas-tokenvalidator
|Once a user authenticates, ${branding} creates a CAS auth token which gets passed to the STS. This
token contains a CAS proxy ticket which the STS can use to retrieve user attributes from the CAS
server. The STS uses the CAS token validator to process these auth tokens and create a SAML
assertion.

|security-sts-casclaimshandler
|The CAS claims handler performs final processing on the user attributes returned by CAS. It
takes a list of attributes and maps them to claims that ${branding} can use according to a
user-defined mapping.

The diagram below gives an overview of the process of logging in for an unauthenticated user,
showing where each of the features are used.

. An unauthenticated user submits a request to a context in ${branding} which is configured to use
CAS authentication.
. The CAS client receives the request. It sees the user is unauthenticated and has no service
ticket, and so redirects the user to CAS.
. CAS displays the login page and the user submits their credentials.
. CAS queries the user store for the given credentials. If the user does not exist, CAS will
indicate that the credentials are invalid. Otherwise, the process will continue. Note that CAS
supports many user management solutions, e.g. LDAP, Active Directory, X.509 certificates, etc.
. CAS redirects the user back to ${branding} with a service ticket.
. Again, the CAS client receives the request, but this time it finds the service ticket. The client
sends a request to CAS to validate the ticket and also generate a proxy ticket. This proxy ticket
allows a designated service (in this case the STS) to request user info from CAS. The client
creates a CAS auth token containing the proxy ticket and sends it to the STS.
Note: the ticket validation request is not shown.
. The STS first passes the auth token to the CAS token validator. The validator extracts the proxy
ticket and retrieves any user attributes that CAS is configured to release. The claims handler then
maps these to standard ${branding} claims, and the STS returns an assertion containing these
processed claims.
. ${branding} then decides whether to display the requested resource.

=== CAS Integration Using Standalone Servers
Integrating ${branding} with a local CAS server is as simple as installing and configuring the
provided CAS features. However, things become a bit more complicated when the required components
are installed on separate servers. This section provides step-by-step instructions for configuring
each component in such a distributed setup. In particular, it will use LDAP as the user management
solution.

TIP: It is important to keep track of the DNS hostnames used on each server for certificate
authentication purposes.

It is possible to configure the STS to query LDAP directly to retrieve user attributes. However, it
is recommended that the STS retrieve attributes through CAS instead. This simplifies integration, as
only CAS must be able to query LDAP. It also allows CAS to use any user management solution without
affecting ${branding}.

==== LDAP
LDAP is used to maintain a list of trusted ${branding} users and the attributes associated with
them. CAS queries it to determine if a user's credentials are valid, and to retrieve user attributes.

. Obtain and unzip the ${branding} kernel: ${branding}-distribution-kernel-<VERSION>.zip.
. Start the distribution
. Deploy the Embedded LDAP application by copying the ldap-embedded-app-<VERSION>.kar into the
`<DISTRIBUTION>/deploy` directory. Verify that the LDAP server is installed by checking the
${branding} log or by performing an `la` command and verifying that the OpenDJ bundle is in the
active state. Additionally, it should respond to LDAP requests on the default ports, which are
1389 and 1636.
. Copy the assigned LDAP keystore and truststore files into the `<DISTRIBUTION>/etc/keystores`
folder, making sure they overwrite the existing serverKeystore.jks and serverTruststore.jks files.
. Open the `<DISTRIBUTION>/etc/system.properties file` and make sure the keystore passwords are set
correctly.

TIP: The LDAP truststore file must contain the CAS server certificate. Otherwise, authentication
will fail.

==== CAS
CAS provides the authentication component for an SSO solution. Unlike LDAP and STS, version 3.x of
the CAS server cannot be run inside ${branding}. Instead, it must be run using Tomcat. Deploying
the CAS server is outside the scope of this guide, so follow the official CAS documentation to
install and configure Tomcat/CAS. After installation

. Open the <TOMCAT>/webapps/cas/WEB-INF/cas.properties file and modify the
cas.ldap.host, cas.ldap.port, cas.ldap.user.dn, and cas.ldap.password fields to allow CAS to the
embedded LDAP instance.
. Configure CAS to provide user attributes when using the CAS protocol. CAS 3.x does not support
this by default, but attribute release can be enabled with a few small changes. See
https://wiki.jasig.org/display/casum/attributes for more information.

TIP: The CAS server truststore must contain the certificates for the embedded LDAP, STS server, and
${branding}.

==== STS
The Security Token Service, unlike the LDAP, cannot currently be installed on a kernel distribution
of ${branding}. To run an STS-only ${branding} installation, uninstall the catalog components that
are not being used. This will increase performance. A list of unneeded components can be found on
the STS page.

. Copy the assigned STS keystore and truststore files into the `<DISTRIBUTION>/etc/keystores`
folder, making sure they overwrite the existing serverKeystore.jks and serverTruststore.jks files.
+
TIP: The STS truststore must contain certificates for ${branding} and the CAS server.
. Open the `<DISTRIBUTION>/etc/system.properties file` and make sure the keystore passwords are set
correctly.
. Start the distribution
. Enter the following commands to install the features used by the STS server:
+
----
feature:install security-sts-server
feature:install security-cas-tokenvalidator
feature:install security-sts-casclaimshandler
----
. Open the Admin Console and navigate to the System tab. The default admin credentials are:
`username=admin`, `password=admin`
. Open the *Security STS CAS Token Validator* configuration.
. Under *CAS Server URL*, type the URL for the CAS server, e.g. `https://cas:8443/cas`
. Select the *Save* button
. Open the *Security STS CAS Claims Handler* configuration.
. Add attribute mappings to assign standard ${branding} claims from the appropriate CAS attribute.
For example, suppose CAS is configured to return attributes `uid` and `email`:
+
----
http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier=uid
http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress=email
----

All of the authentication components should be running and configured at this point.
The final step is to configure a ${branding} instance to use CAS authentication.

==== Configuring ${branding}
Once everything is configured and running, hooking up an existing ${branding} instance to the
authentication scheme is performed by setting a few configuration properties.

. Copy the assigned ${branding} keystore and truststore files into the `<DISTRIBUTION>/etc/keystores`
folder, making sure they overwrite the existing serverKeystore.jks and serverTruststore.jks files.
+
TIP: The ${branding} truststore must contain certificates for the STS and CAS servers.
. Open the `<DISTRIBUTION>/etc/system.properties file` and make sure the keystore passwords are set
correctly.
. Start the distribution.
. Install the CAS client
+
----
feature:install security-cas-client
----
. In the Admin Console navigate to the System tab and open the *Security CAS Client* configuration.
. Set each configuration as appropriate for your environment. For example:
+
----
Server Name:        https://dib:8993/
CAS Server URL:     https://cas:8443/cas
CAS Login URL:      https://cas:8443/cas/login
CAS Logout URL:     https://cas:8443/cas/logout
Proxy Callback URL: https://localhost:8993/sso
Proxy Receptor URL: /sso
----
. Open the *Security STS Client* configuration. Verify that the host/port information in the
*STS WSDL Address* field points to the STS server.
. Open the *Web Context Policy Manager.
. Under authentication types, assign CAS auth to the contexts which should be protected. In general,
SAML auth should also be used. This avoids redirecting to CAS whenever hitting a new context in
${branding}, and so provides a noticeable performance benefit when first loading the UI. For
example:
+
----
/search=SAML|CAS
----

The ${branding} should now use the CAS/STS servers when it attempts to authenticate a user upon an
attempted login.
