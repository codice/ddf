${branding} does not define accounts or types of accounts to support access.
${branding} uses an _attribute based access control_ (*ABAC*) model.
For reference, ABAC systems control access by evaluating rules against the attributes of the entities (_subject_ and _object_), actions, and the environment relevant to a request.

${branding} can be configured to access many different types of user stores to manage and monitor user access.
