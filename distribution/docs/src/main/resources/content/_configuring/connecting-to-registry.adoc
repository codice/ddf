== {title}

Another approach to configuring federation is to use the *${ddf-registry}* application to locate sources in a network/enterprise.
See <<{reference-prefix}installing_registry,${ddf-registry} Application Reference>> for details on installing the ${ddf-registry} application.
Use the registry to subscribe to and federate with other instances of ${branding}.

[NOTE]
====
The *Node Information* and *Remote Registries* tabs appear in both the ${ddf-registry} application and the ${ddf-catalog} application.

[NOTE]
====
For direct federation configuration, sources and registries can be configured at https://{FQDN}:{PORT}/admin/federation.
