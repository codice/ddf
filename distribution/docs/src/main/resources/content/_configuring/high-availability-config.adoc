== Configuring for Highly Available Cluster

This section describes how to make configuration changes after the initial setup for a ${branding} in a <<_high_availability,Highly Available Cluster>>.

In a Highly Available Cluster, configuration changes must be made on both ${branding} nodes.
The change can still be made in the standard ways via the <<_admin_console_tutorial,Admin Console>>,
the <<_console_command_reference,Command Line>>, or the <<_configuration_files, file system>>.

[NOTE]
====
Changes made in the Admin Console must be made through the HTTP proxy.
This means that the HTTP proxy must be forced to switch to each node in order to make the change on that node.
