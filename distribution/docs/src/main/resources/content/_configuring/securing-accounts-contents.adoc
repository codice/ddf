=== Configuring Accounts

* *{hardening-step}*

${branding} does not define accounts or types of accounts to support access.
${branding} uses an _attribute based access control_ (*ABAC*) model.
For reference, ABAC systems control access by evaluating rules against the attributes of the entities (_subject_ and _object_), actions, and the environment relevant to a request.

The default security configuration uses a property file located at `<${branding}_HOME>/etc/users.properties` to store users and passwords.
A hardened system will remove this file and manage all users externally, via an LDAP server or by other means.
