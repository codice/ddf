* *{hardening-step}*

Be sure to limit the hosts that are allowed to connect to the STS:

* Open the `${home_directory}/etc/system.properties` file.
* Edit the line `ws-security.subject.cert.constraints = .*`.
** Remove the `.*` and replace with a comma-delimited list of regular expressions for the DNs of all desired hosts (`<MY_HOST_DN>`):
*** `ws-security.subject.cert.constraints = <MY_HOST_DN>,<OTHER_HOST_DN>`
