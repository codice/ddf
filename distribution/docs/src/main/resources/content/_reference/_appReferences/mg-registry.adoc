To use the ${ddf-registry}, the following apps/features must be installed:

===  Customizing ${ddf-registry} Fields

All the fields that appear in a registry node are customizable. This is done through a JSON configuration file located at ``${home_directory}/etc/registry/registry-custom-slots.json`` that defines the registry fields. In this file there are JSON objects that relate to each part of the edit registry modal.
These objects are

* General
* Service
** ServiceBinding
* Organization
* Person (Contact)
* Content (Content Collection)

Each of the objects listed above is a JSON array of field objects that can be modified. There are some other objects in the JSON file like *PersonName*, *Address*, *TelephoneNumber*, and *EmailAddress* that should not be modified.
