:title: Introduction to High Availability
:order: 10

${branding} can be made to be highly available. In this context, High Availability is defined as the ability for the ${branding} to be continuously operational with very little down time.

In a Highly Available Cluster, the ${branding} has failover capabilities when a system fails.
This setup consists of a Solr Cloud instance, 2 ${branding} nodes connected to that Solr Cloud, and a load balancer that sits in front of those 2 nodes.
One of the ${branding} nodes will be arbitrarily chosen to be the active node, and the other will be the standby node.
The load balancer will route all traffic to the active node.
If the active node fails for any reason, the standby node will become active and the load balancer will route all traffic to the new active node.
See the below diagrams for more detail.

There are special procedures for initial setup and configuration of a highly available ${branding}. See <<_high_availability_initial_setup,High Availability Initial Setup>> and <<_configuring_for_highly_available_cluster,High Availability Configuration>> for those procedures.
