:title: Introduction to Ingest
:order: 03

Ingest is the process of bringing data products, metadata, or both into the catalog to enable search, sharing, and discovery.
Ingested files are <<_transformers,transformed>> into a neutral format that can be searched against as well as migrated to other formats and systems.
See <<_ingesting_data, Ingesting Data>> for the various methods of ingesting data.

Upon ingest, a transformer will read the metadata from the ingested file and populate the fields of a metacard.
Exactly how this is accomplished depends on the origin of the data, but most fields (except id) are imported directly.
