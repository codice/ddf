:title: Introduction to Endpoints
:order: 09

Endpoints expose the Catalog Framework to clients using protocols and formats that the clients understand.

Endpoint interface formats encompass a variety of protocols, including (but not limited to):

* SOAP Web services
* RESTful services
* JMS
* JSON
* OpenSearch

The endpoint may transform a client request into a compatible Catalog format and then transform the response into a compatible client format.
Endpoints may use <<_transformers,Transformers>> to perform these transformations.
This allows an endpoint to interact with Source(s) that have different interfaces.
For example, an OpenSearch Endpoint can send a query to the Catalog Framework, which could then query a federated source that has no OpenSearch interface.

Endpoints are meant to be the only client-accessible components in the Catalog.
