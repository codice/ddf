:summary: Using OSGi within ${branding}.
:order: 01

${branding} runs on top of an OSGi framework, a Java virtual machine (JVM), several choices of operating systems, and the physical hardware infrastructure.
The items within the dotted line represent the standard ${branding} components.

${branding} is a customized and branded distribution of http://karaf.apache.org/[Apache Karaf].
${branding} could also be considered to be a more lightweight OSGi distribution, as compared to Apache ServiceMix, FUSE ESB, or Talend ESB, all of which are also built upon Apache Karaf.
Similar to its peers, ${branding} incorporates (https://tools.codice.org/#DDFArchitecture-AdditionalUpstreamDependencies[additional upstream dependencies]).

The ${branding} framework hosts ${branding} applications, which are extensible by adding components via OSGi.
The best example of this is the ${branding} Catalog (API), which offers extensibility via several types of Catalog Components.
The ${branding} Catalog API serves as the foundation for several applications and resides in the applications tier.

The Catalog Components consist of <<_endpoints,Endpoints>>, <<_plugins,Plugins>>, <<_catalog_frameworks,Catalog Frameworks>>, <<_sources,Sources>>, and <<_catalog_providers,Catalog Providers>>.
Customized components can be added to ${branding}.

Capability:: A general term used to refer to an ability of the system.
Component:: Represents a portion of an Application that can be extended.
Bundle:: Java Archives (JARs) with special OSGi manifest entries.
Feature:: One or more bundles that form an installable unit; defined by Apache Karaf but portable to other OSGi containers.
Application:: One or more features that together form a cohesive collection of capabilities.

==== Packaging Capabilities as Bundles

Services and code are physically deployed to ${branding} using bundles.
The bundles within ${branding} are created using the maven bundle plug-in.
Bundles are Java JAR files that have additional metadata in the `MANIFEST.MF` that is relevant to an OSGi container.

The best resource for learning about the structure and headers in the manifest definition is in section 3.6 of the https://osgi.org/download/r5/osgi.core-5.0.0.pdf[OSGi Core Specification].
The bundles within ${branding} are created using the http://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-maven-bundle-plugin-bnd.html[maven bundle plug-in], which uses the http://bnd.bndtools.org/[BND tool].

.Alternative Bundle Creation Methods
[TIP]
====
Using Maven is not necessary to create bundles.
Many alternative tools exist, and OSGi manifest files can also be created by hand, although hand-editing should be avoided by most developers.

===== Creating a Bundle

====== Bundle Development Recommendations

Avoid creating bundles by hand or editing a manifest file:: Many tools exist for creating bundles, notably the Maven Bundle plugin, which handle the details of OSGi configuration and automate the bundling process including generation of the manifest file.
Always make a distinction on which imported packages are `optional` or `required`:: Requiring every package when not necessary can cause an unnecessary dependency ripple effect among bundles.
Embedding is an implementation detail:: Using the `Embed-Dependency` instruction provided by the `maven-bundle-plugin` will insert the specified jar(s) into the target archive and add them to the `Bundle-ClassPath`. These jars and their contained packages/classes are not for public consumption; they are for the internal implementation of this service implementation only.
Bundles should never be embedded:: Bundles expose service implementations; they do not provide arbitrary classes to be used by other bundles.
Bundles should expose service implementations:: This is the corollary to the previous rule. Bundles should not be created when arbitrary concrete classes are being extracted to a library. In that case, a library/jar is the appropriate module packaging type.
Bundles should generally _only_ export service packages:: If there are packages internal to a bundle that comprise its implementation but not its public manifestation of the API, they should be excluded from export and kept as private packages.
Concrete objects that are not loaded by the root classloader should not be passed in or out of a bundle:: This is a general rule with some exceptions (JAXB generated classes being the most prominent example). Where complex objects need to be passed in or out of a service method, an interface should be defined in the API bundle.

Bundles separate contract from implementation and allow for modularized development and deployment of functionality.
For that to be effective, they must be defined and used correctly so inadvertent coupling does not occur.
Good bundle definition and usage leads to a more flexible environment.

====== Maven Bundle Plugin

Below is a code snippet from a Maven `pom.xml` for creating an OSGi Bundle using the Maven Bundle plugin.

===== Third Party and Utility Bundles

It is recommended to avoid building directly on included third party and utility bundles.
These components do provide utility and reuse potential; however, they may be upgraded or even replaced at anytime as bug fixes and new capabilities dictate.
For example, web services may be built using CXF.
However, the distributions frequently upgrade CXF between releases to take advantage of new features.
If building on these components, be aware of the version upgrades with each distribution release.

Instead, component developers should package and deliver their own dependencies to ensure future compatibility.
For example, if re-using a bundle, the specific bundle version that you are depending on should be included in your packaged release, and the proper versions should be referenced in your bundle(s).

===== Deploying a Bundle

A bundle is typically installed in one of two ways:

. Installed as a feature
. Hot deployed in the `/deploy` directory

The fastest way to deploy a created bundle during development is to copy it to the `/deploy` directory of a running ${branding}.
This directory checks for new bundles and deploys them immediately.
According to Karaf documentation, "Karaf supports hot deployment of OSGi bundles by monitoring JAR files inside the `[home]/deploy` directory.
Each time a JAR is copied in this folder, it will be installed inside the runtime.
It can be updated or deleted and changes will be handled automatically.
In addition, Karaf also supports exploded bundles and custom deployers (Blueprint and Spring DM are included by default)."
Once deployed, the bundle should come up in the Active state, if all of the dependencies were properly met.
When this occurs, the service is available to be used.

===== Verifying Bundle State

To verify if a bundle is deployed and running, go to the running command console and view the status.

* Execute the `list` command.
* If the name of the bundle is known, the `list` command can be piped to the `grep` command to quickly find the bundle.

The example below shows how to verify if a Client is deployed and running.

.Verifying with grep
----
${ddf-branding-lowercase}${at-symbol}local>list | grep -i example
[ 162] [Active    ] [       ] [  ] [ 80] ${ddf-branding} :: Registry :: example Client (2.0.0)
----

The state is `Active`, indicating that the bundle is ready for program execution.

==== Working with Features Files

Features XML files group other features and/or bundle(s) for ease of installation/uninstallation.

In order to ensure that the installer can correctly interpret and display application details, there are several guidelines that should be followed when creating the features file for the application.

* Ensure only one feature in the `features.xml` has the same name as the project itself. (e.g. If the project name is `spatial-app`, there should be one feature named `spatial-app`)
This is the feature that the installer displays to the user (name, description, version, etc.) and  provides the description of what the application contains.
This feature should only declare the `prerequisite` features of the app and any bundles or features that are required by all of the features within the app.
* Be sure all features that should be installed by default include the `auto-install` flag.

----
install='auto'

+
* Each feature should declare its `prerequisite` features. These are the features that are required to be installed prior to this feature starting up. At a minimum this should include the application feature, so that the application prerequisites and required dependencies are satisified before this feature starts.

----
<feature prerequisite="true">feature1</feature>

===== Auto-starting an Application Feature

Within the `features.xml` file for an application, the feature that is named the same as the project will have the install attribute set to `auto`.
Within this feature, refer to any prerequisites of the application as well as any features or bundles within the application that are required by all features.
Features that should start automatically should have install set to `auto`.
Other features should have install set to `manual`.

The following example demonstrates configuring features to be auto-started. The naming convention for this feature is typically "`application name`" + "`-app`," as shown.

    <feature prerequisite="true">example-app</feature>
    <bundle>mvn:com.example/example.auto/1.3</bundle>
