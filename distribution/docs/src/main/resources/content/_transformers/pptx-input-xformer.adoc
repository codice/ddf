:summary: Translates Microsoft PowerPoint (OOXML only) documents into Catalog Metacards.

The PPTX Input Transformer translates Microsoft PowerPoint (OOXML only) documents into Catalog Metacards, using https://tika.apache.org/[Apache Tika] for basic metadata and https://poi.apache.org/[Apache POI] for thumbnail creation.
The PPTX Input Transformer ingests PPTX documents into the ${branding} Content Repository and the Metadata Catalog, and adds a thumbnail of the first page in the PPTX document.
