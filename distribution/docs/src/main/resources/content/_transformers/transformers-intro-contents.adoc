Transformers transform data to and from various formats.
Transformers are categorized by when they are invoked and used.
The <<_types_of_transformers,existing types>> are <<_available_input_transformers,Input transformers>>, <<_available_metacard_transformers,Metacard transformers>>, and <<_query_response_transformers,Query Response transformers>>.
Additionally, XSLT transformers are provided to aid in developing custom, lightweight Metacard and Query Response transformers.

Transformers are utility objects used to transform a set of standard ${branding} components into a desired format, such as into PDF, GeoJSON, XML, or any other format.
For instance, a transformer can be used to convert a set of query results into an easy-to-read GeoJSON format (<<_geojson_transformer,GeoJSON Transformer>>) or convert a set of results into a RSS feed that can be easily published to a URL for RSS feed subscription.
Transformers can be registered in the OSGi Service Registry so that any other developer can access them based on their standard interface and self-assigned identifier, referred to as its "shortname."
Transformers are often used by endpoints for data conversion in a system standard way.
Multiple endpoints can use the same transformer, a different transformer, or their own published transformer.

[WARNING]
====
The current transformers only work for UTF-8 characters and do not support Non-Western Characters (for example, Hebrew).
It is recommend not to use international character sets, as they may not be displayed properly.

Transformers are used to alter the format of a resource or its metadata to or from the catalogâ€™s metacard format.

.[[_types_of_transformers]]Types of Transformers
<<_available_input_transformers,Input Transformers>>:: Input Transformers create metacards from input. Once converted to a Metacard, the data can be used in a variety of ways, such as in an `UpdateRequest`, `CreateResponse`, or within Catalog Endpoints or Sources. For instance, an input transformer could be used to receive and translate XML into a Metacard so that it can be placed within a `CreateRequest` in order to be ingested within the Catalog. Input transformers should be registered within the Service Registry with the interface `ddf.catalog.transform.InputTransformer` in order to notify Catalog components of any new transformers.

<<_available_metacard_transformers,Metacard Transformers>>:: Metacard Transformers translate a metacard from catalog metadata to a specific data format.

<<_available_query_response_transformers,Query Response Transformers>>:: Query Response transformers convert query responses into other data formats.
