[WARNING]
====
Note that the Metrics endpoint URL is marked "internal."
This indicates that this endpoint is intended for internal use by the ${branding} code.
This endpoint is subject to change in future versions.
====

The Metrics Endpoint is used by the <<{reference-prefix}metrics_collection_application,Metrics Collection Application>> to report on system metrics.

===== Installing the Metrics Endpoint

The Metrics Endpoint is installed by default with a standard installation in the ${ddf-platform} application.

===== Configuring the Metrics Endpoint

No configuration can be made for the Metrics Endpoint.
All of the metrics that it collects data on are pre-configured in ${branding}.

===== Using the Metrics Endpoint

====== Metrics Data Supported Formats

The metric's historical data can be displayed in several formats, including PNG , a CSV file, an Excel .xls file, a PowerPoint .ppt file, an XML file, and a JSON file.
The PNG, CSV, and XLS formats are accessed via hyperlinks provided in the Metrics tab web page.
The PPT, XML, and JSON formats are accessed by specifying the format in the custom URL, e.g., ${public_url}/services/internal/metrics/catalogQueries.json?dateOffset=1800.

The table below describes each of the supported formats, how to access them, and an example where applicable. (NOTE: all example URLs begin with \${secure_url} which is omitted in the table for brevity.)

====== Add Custom Metrics to the Metrics Tab

It is possible to add custom (or existing, but non-collected) metrics to the Metrics tab by writing an application.
Refer to the SDK example source code for Sample Metrics located in the ${branding} source code at `sdk/sample-metrics` and `sdk/sdk-app`.

[WARNING]
====
The Metrics framework is not an open API, but rather a closed, internal framework that can change at any time in future releases.
Be aware that any custom code written may not work with future releases.
====

===== Usage Limitations of the Metrics Endpoint

The Metrics Collecting Application uses a “round robin” database.
It uses one that does not store individual values but, instead, stores the rate of change between values at different times. 
Due to the nature of this method of storage, along with the fact that some processes can cross time frames, small discrepancies (differences in values of one or two have been experienced) may appear in values for different time frames. 
These will be especially apparent for reports covering shorter time frames such as 15 minutes or one hour. 
These are due to the averaging of data over time periods and should not impact the values over longer periods of time.
