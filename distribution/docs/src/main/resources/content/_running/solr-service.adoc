These instructions are for configuring Solr as a service managed by the operating system.

===== Configure Solr as a Windows Service

Windows users can use the *Task Scheduler* to start Solr as a background process.

. If ${branding} is running, stop it.
. Edit `${home_directory}/etc/custom.system.properties` and set `start.solr=false`.
  This prevents the ${branding} scripts from attempting to manage Solr's lifecycle.
. Start the *Windows Task Scheduler* and open the *Task Scheduler Library*.
. Under the Actions pane, select *Create Basic Task...*.
. Provide a useful name and description, then select *Next*.
. Select *When the computer starts* as the Trigger and select *Next*.
. Select *Start a program* as the Action and select *Next*.
. Select the script to start Solr:
+
-----
${home_directory}\bin\ddfsolr.bat
-----
+
. Add the argument `start` in the window pane and select *Next*.
. Review the settings and select *Finish*.

It may be necessary to update the *Security Options* under the task *Properties* to
*Run with highest privileges* or setting user to "SYSTEM".

Additionally, the process can be set to restart if it fails. The option can be found in the
 the *Properties* > *Settings* tab.

Depending on the system it may also make sense to delay the process from starting for a
few minutes until the machine has fully booted. Open the task's *Properties* settings and

 .. Select *Triggers*.
 .. Select *Edit*.
 .. Select *Advanced Settings*.
 .. Select *Delay Task*.


===== Configure Solr as a Systemd Service
These instructions are for unix operating systems running the systemd
 init manager. If configuring a Windows system, see
 <<{managing-prefix}configure_solr_as_a_windows_service,Configure Solr as a Windows Service>>


. If ${branding} is running, stop it.
. Edit `${home_directory}/etc/custom.system.properties` and set `start.solr=false`.
. Edit the file `${home_directory}/solr/services/solr.service`
  .. Edit the property `Environment=JAVA_HOME` and replace `<JAVA_HOME>` with the absolute path
  to the directory where the Java Runtime Environment is installed.
  .. Edit the property `ExecStart` and replace ${home_directory} with the absolute path to the `ddfsolr` file.
  .. Edit the property `ExecStop` and replace ${home_directory} with the absolute path to the `ddfsolr` file.
  .. Edit the property `User` and replace `<USER>` with the user ID of the Solr process owner.
. From the operating system command line, enable a Solr service using a provided configuration file.
Use the full path to the file.
+
----
systemctl enable ${home_directory}/solr/service/solr.service
----

. Start the service.
+
----
systemctl start solr
----

. Check the status of Solr
+
----
systemctl status solr
----

Solr will start automatically each time the system is booted.
