== {title}

The Command Scheduler allows administrators to schedule Command Line Commands to be run at specified intervals.

The Command Scheduler allows administrators to schedule Command Line Shell Commands to be run in a platform-independent way.
For instance, if an administrator wanted to use the Catalog commands to export all records of a Catalog to a directory, the administrator could write a cron job or a scheduled task to remote into the container and execute the command.
Writing these types of scripts are specific to the administrator's operating system and also requires extra logic for error handling if the container is up.
The administrator can also create a Command Schedule, which currently requires only two fields.
The Command Scheduler only runs when the container is running, so there is no need to verify if the container is up.
In addition, when the container is restarted, the commands are rescheduled and executed again.
A command will be repeatedly executed indefinitely according to the configured interval until the container is shutdown or the Scheduled Command is deleted.

[NOTE]
====
There will be further attempts to execute the command according to the configured interval even if an attempt fails.
See the log for details about failures.

=== Schedule a Command

Configure the Command Scheduler to execute a command at specific intervals.

. Navigate to the *${admin-console}* (\${secure_url}/admin).
. Select the *${ddf-platform}* application.
. Click on the *Configuration* tab.
. Select *Platform Command Scheduler*.
. Enter the command or commands to be executed in the *Command* text field. Commands can be separated by a semicolon and will execute in order from left to right.
. Enter an interval in the *Interval* field. This can either be a Quartz Cron expression or a positive integer (seconds) (e.x. `0 0 0 1/1 * ? *` or `12`).
. Select the interval type in the *Interval Type* drop-down.
. Click the *Save changes* button.

[NOTE]
====
Scheduling commands will be delayed by 1 minute to allow time for bundles to load when ${branding} is starting up.

=== Updating a Scheduled Command

Change the timing, order, or execution of scheduled commands.

. Navigate to the *${admin-console}*.
. Click on the *${ddf-platform}* application.
. Click on the *Configuration* tab.
. Under the *Platform Command Scheduler* configuration are all of the scheduled commands.
Scheduled commands have the following syntax: `${ddf-branding-lowercase}.platform.scheduler.Command.{GUID}` such as `${ddf-branding-lowercase}.platform.scheduler.Command.4d60c917-003a-42e8-9367-1da0f822ca6e`.
. Find the desired configuration to modify, and update fields.
. Click the *Save changes* button.

=== Output of Scheduled Commands

Commands that normally write out to the console will write out to the log.
For example, if an `echo "Hello World"` command is set to run every five seconds, the log contains the following:

.Sample Command Output in the Log
----
16:01:32,582 | INFO  | heduler_Worker-1 | ${ddf-branding-lowercase}.platform.scheduler.CommandJob          68 | platform-scheduler   | Executing command [echo Hello World]
16:01:32,583 | INFO  | heduler_Worker-1 | ${ddf-branding-lowercase}.platform.scheduler.CommandJob          70 | platform-scheduler   | Execution Output: Hello World
16:01:37,581 | INFO  | heduler_Worker-4 | ${ddf-branding-lowercase}.platform.scheduler.CommandJob          68 | platform-scheduler   | Executing command [echo Hello World]
16:01:37,582 | INFO  | heduler_Worker-4 | ${ddf-branding-lowercase}.platform.scheduler.CommandJob          70 | platform-scheduler   | Execution Output: Hello World
----

In short, administrators can view the status of a run within the log as long as INFO was set as the status level.
