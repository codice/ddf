${branding} has many ways to remove expired records from the underlying Catalog data store.
Nevertheless, the benefits of data standardization is that an attempt can be made to remove records without the need to know any vendor-specific information.
Whether the data store is a search server, a No-SQL database, or a relational database, expired records can be removed universally using the Catalog API and the Catalog Commands.
