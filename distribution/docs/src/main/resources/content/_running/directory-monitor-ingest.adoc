The ${ddf-catalog} application contains a Content Directory Monitor feature that allows files placed in a single directory to be monitored and ingested automatically.
For more information about configuring a directory to be monitored, see <<{managing-prefix}configuring_the_content_directory_monitor,Configuring the Content Directory Monitor>>.

Files placed in the monitored directory will be ingested automatically.
If a file cannot be ingested, they will be moved to an automatically-created directory named `.errors`.
More information about the ingest operations can be found in the ingest log.
The default location of the log is `${home_directory}/data/log/ingest_error.log`.
Optionally, ingested files can be automatically moved to a directory called `.ingested`.
