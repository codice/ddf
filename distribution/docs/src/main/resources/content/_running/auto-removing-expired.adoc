By default, the ${branding} runs a scheduled command every 24 hours to remove expired records.
The command is executed and scheduled by the <<{managing-prefix}command_scheduler,Command Scheduler>>.
To change the configuration, follow the <<{managing-prefix}updating_a_scheduled_command,Updating a Scheduled Command>> instructions.
If an administrator wants to create additional scheduled tasks to remove records from the local Catalog, the administrator can follow the steps provided in the Scheduling a Command section.
In the Command text field, type the following:

`catalog:removeall --force --expired`

If it is intended to have this run daily, type 86400 for the number of seconds.
(60 seconds/min x 60 minutes/hr x 24 hours/day = 86400 seconds for one day)
