Once the distribution has started, administrators will have access to a powerful command line console, the ${command-console}.
This ${command-console} can be used to manage services, install new features, and manage the state of the system.

The ${command-console} is available to the user when the distribution is started manually or may also be accessed by using the `bin/client.bat` or `bin/client` scripts.

[NOTE]
====
The majority of functionality and information available on the ${admin-console} is also available on the Command Line Console.
