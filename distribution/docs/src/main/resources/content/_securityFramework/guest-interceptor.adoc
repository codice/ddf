:summary: Guest Interceptor.

The goal of the `GuestInterceptor` is to allow non-secure clients (such as SOAP requests without security headers) to access secure service endpoints. 

All requests to secure endpoints must satisfy the WS-SecurityPolicy that is included in the WSDL 

Rather than reject requests without user credentials, the guest interceptor
detects the missing credentials and inserts an assertion that represents the "guest" user.
The attributes included in this guest user assertion are configured by the administrator to represent any unknown user on the current network.

===== Installing Guest Interceptor

The `GuestInterceptor` is installed by default with ${ddf-security} Application.

===== Configuring Guest Interceptor

Configure the Guest Interceptor from the ${admin-console}:

. Navigate to the ${admin-console} at ${secure_url}/admin
. Click the ${ddf-security} application tile
. Click the *Configuration* tab
. Click the *Security STS Guest Claims Handler* configuration
. Click the + next to Attributes to add a new attribute
. Add any addtional attributes that you want every user to have
. Click *Save changes*

Once these configurations have been added, the GuestInterceptor is ready for use.
Both secure and non-secure requests will be accepted by all secure ${branding} service endpoints.
