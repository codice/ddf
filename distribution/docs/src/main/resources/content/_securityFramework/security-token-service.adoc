:summary: Security Token Service.

The Security Token Service (STS) is a service running in ${branding} that generates SAML v2.0 assertions.
These assertions are then used to authenticate a client allowing them to issue other requests, such as ingests or queries to ${branding} services.

The STS is an extension of Apache CXF-STS.
It is a SOAP web service that utilizes WS-Trust.
The generated SAML assertions contain attributes about a user and is used by the Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) in the secure endpoints.
Specific configuration details on the bundles that come with ${branding} can be found on the Security STS application page.
This page details all of the STS components that come out of the box with ${branding}, along with configuration options, installation help, and which services they import and export.

The STS server contains validators, claim handlers, and token issuers to process incoming requests.
When a request is received, the validators first ensure that it is valid.
The validators verify authentication against configured services, such as LDAP, DIAS, PKI.
If the request is found to be invalid, the process ends and an error is returned.
Next, the claims handlers determine how to handle the request, adding user attributes or properties as configured.
The token issuer creates a SAML 2.0 assertion and associates it with the subject.
The STS server sends an assertion back to the requestor, which is used to authenticate and authorize subsequent SOAP and REST requests.

The STS can be used to generate SAML v2.0 assertions via a SOAP web service request.
Out of the box, the STS supports authentication from existing SAML tokens, CAS proxy tickets, username/password, and x509 certificates.
It also supports retrieving claims using LDAP and properties files.
