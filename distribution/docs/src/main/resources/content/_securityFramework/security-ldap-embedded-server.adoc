:summary: Embedded LDAP server.

${branding} includes an embedded LDAP server (OpenDJ) for testing and demonstration purposes.

[WARNING]
====
The embedded LDAP server is intended for testing purposes only and is not recommended for production use.
====

===== Installing the Embedded LDAP Server

The embedded LDAP server is not installed by default with a standard installation.

. Navigate to the ${admin-console}.
. Select *Manage* Applications.
. Install the *OpenDJ Embedded* application.

===== Configuring the Embedded LDAP

Configure the Embedded LDAP from the ${admin-console}:

. Navigate to the *${admin-console}*.
. Select *Manage* Applications.
. Start the *OpenDj Embedded* application.
. Once started, select the *OpenDj* application.
. Select the *Configuration* tab.

|===

|Configuration Name
|Description

|LDAP Port
|Sets the port for LDAP (plaintext and startTLS). 0 will disable the port.

|LDAPS Port
|Sets the port for LDAPS. 0 will disable the port.

|Base LDIF File
|Location on the server for a LDIF file.
This file will be loaded into the LDAP and overwrite any existing entries.
This option should be used when updating the default groups/users with a new LDIF file for testing.
The LDIF file being loaded may contain any LDAP entries (schemas, users, groups, etc.).
If the location is left blank, the default base LDIF file will be used that comes with ${branding}.

|===

===== Connecting to Standalone LDAP Servers

${branding} instances can connect to external LDAP servers by installing and configuring the `security-sts-ldaplogin` and `security-sts-ldapclaimshandler` features detailed here.

In order to connect to more than one LDAP server, configure these features for each LDAP server.

===== Embedded LDAP Configuration

The Embedded LDAP application contains an LDAP server (OpenDJ version 2.6.2) that has a default set of schemas and users loaded to help facilitate authentication and authorization testing.

===== Starting and Stopping the Embedded LDAP

The embedded LDAP application installs a feature with the name `ldap-embedded`.
Installing and uninstalling this feature will start and stop the embedded LDAP server.
This will also install a fresh instance of the server each time.
If changes need to persist, stop then start the `embedded-ldap-opendj` bundle (rather than installing/uninstalling the feature).

All settings, configurations, and changes made to the embedded LDAP instances are persisted across ${branding} restarts.
If ${branding} is stopped while the LDAP feature is installed and started, it will automatically restart with the saved settings on the next ${branding} start.

===== Limitations of the Embedded LDAP

Current limitations for the embedded LDAP instances include:

* Inability to store the LDAP files/storage outside of the ${branding} installation directory. This results in any LDAP data (i.e., LDAP user information) being lost when the `ldap-embedded` feature is uninstalled.
* Cannot be run standalone from ${branding}. In order to run `embedded-ldap`, the ${branding} must be started.

===== External Links for the Embedded LDAP

===== LDAP Administration

OpenDJ provides a number of tools for LDAP administration. Refer to the http://opendj.forgerock.org/opendj-server/doc/admin-guide/[OpenDJ Admin Guide].

===== Downloading the Admin Tools

Download http://www.forgerock.org/opendj-archive.html[OpenDJ (Version 2.4.6)] and the included tool suite.

===== Using the Admin Tools

The admin tools are located in `<opendj-installation>/bat` for Windows and `<opendj-installation>/bin` for `*nix`. 
These tools can be used to administer both local and remote LDAP servers by setting the *host* and *port* parameters appropriately.


In this example, the user *Bruce Banner (uid=bbanner)* is disabled using the *manage-account* command on Windows.
Run *manage-account --help* for usage instructions.
