== Installation Prerequisites

[WARNING]
====
For security reasons, ${branding} cannot be started from a user's home directory. If attempted, the system will automatically shut down.
====

These are the system/environment requirements to configure _prior_ to an installation.

[NOTE]
====
The ${branding} process or user under which the ${branding} process runs must have permission
to create and write files in the directories where the Solr cores are installed,
If this permission is missing,
${branding} will not be able to create new Solr cores and the system will not function
correctly.
