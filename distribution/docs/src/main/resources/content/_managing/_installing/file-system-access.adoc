== Configuring Operating Permissions and Allocations

Restrict access to sensitive files by ensuring that the only users with access privileges are administrators.

Within the `${home_directory}`, a directory is created named ${branding-lowercase}-${project.version}.
This directory will be referred to in the documentation as `${home_directory}`.

. Do not assume the deployment is from a trusted source; verify its origination.
. Check the available storage space on the system to ensure the deployment will not exceed the available space.
. Set maximum storage space on the `${home_directory}/deploy` and `${home_directory}/system` directories to restrict the amount of space used by deployments.

=== Setting Directory Permissions

* *{hardening-step}*

${branding} relies on the Directory Permissions of the host platform to protect the integrity of the ${branding} during operation.
System administrators MUST perform the following steps prior to deploying bundles added to the ${branding}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The system administrator must restrict certain directories to ensure that the application (user) cannot access restricted directories on the system.
For example the `${branding}USER` should have read-only access to `${home_directory}`, except for the sub-directories `etc`, `data`, `solr` and `instances`.
====

.Setting Directory Permissions on Windows
****
Set directory permissions on the `${home_directory}`; all sub-directories except `etc`, `data`, and `instances`; and any directory intended to interact with the ${branding} to protect from unauthorized access.

. Right-click on the `${home_directory}` directory.
. Select *Properties -> Security -> Advanced*.
. Under *Owner*, select *Change*.
. Enter `Creator Owner` into the *Enter the Object Name...* field.
. Select *Check Names*.
. Select *Apply*.
.. If prompted *Do you wish to continue*, select *Yes*.
. Remove all Permission Entries for any groups or users with access to ${home_directory} other than *System*, *Administrators*, and *Creator Owner*.
.. Note: If prompted with a message such as: *You canâ€™t remove X because this object is inheriting permissions from its parent.* when removing entries from the Permission entries table:
... Select *Disable Inheritance*.
... Select *Convert Inherited Permissions into explicit permissions on this object*.
... Try removing the entry again.
. Select the option for *Replace all child object permission entries with inheritable permission entries from this object*.
. Close the *Advanced Security Settings* window.

****

.Setting Directory Permissions on *NIX
****
Set directory permissions to protect the ${branding} from unauthorized access.

* Change ownership of `${home_directory}`
** `chown -R ${branding-lowercase}-user ${home_directory}`
* Create instances sub-directory if does not exist
** `mkdir -p ${home_directory}/instances`
* Change group ownership on sub-directories
** `chgrp -R ${branding}GROUP ${home_directory}/etc ${home_directory}/data ${home_directory}/instances ${home_directory}/solr`
* Change group permissions
** `chmod -R g-w ${home_directory}/etc ${home_directory}/data ${home_directory}/instances ${home_directory}/solr`
* Remove permissions for other users
** `chmod -R o-rwx ${home_directory}/etc ${home_directory}/data ${home_directory}/instances`

=== Configuring Memory Allocation for the ${branding} Java Virtual Machine

[[_jvm_memory_configuration]]
The amount of memory allocated to the Java Virtual Machine host ${branding} by the operating
system can be increased by updating the `setenv` script:

.Setenv Scripts: *NIX
----
${home_directory}/bin/setenv
Update the JAVA_OPTS -Xmx value
${home_directory}/bin/setenv-wrapper.conf
Update the wrapper.java.additional -Xmx value
----

.Setenv Scripts: Windows
----
${home_directory}/bin/setenv.bat
Update the JAVA_OPTS -Xmx value
${home_directory}/bin/setenv-windows-wrapper.conf
Update the wrapper.java.additional -Xmx value
----

=== Enabling JMX

[[jmx-connectivity-configuration]]
By default, ${branding} prevents connections to JMX because the system is more secure when JMX
 is not enabled. However, many monitoring tools require a JMX connection to the Java Virtual
 Machine. To enable JMX, update the setenv script:

.Setenv Scripts: *NIX
----
${home_directory}/bin/setenv
Remove -XX:+DisableAttachMechanism from JAVA_OPTS
${home_directory}/bin/setenv-wrapper.conf
Comment out the -XX:+DisableAttachMechanism line and re-number remainder lines appropriately
----

.Setenv Scripts: Windows
----
${home_directory}/bin/setenv.bat
Remove -XX:+DisableAttachMechanism from JAVA_OPTS
${home_directory}/bin/setenv-windows-wrapper.conf
Comment out the -XX:+DisableAttachMechanism line and re-number remainder lines appropriately
----

=== Configuring Memory for the Solr Server

[NOTE]
====
This section applies only to configurations that manage the lifecycle of the Solr server.
It does not apply to Solr Cloud configurations.
====
The Solr server consumes large amount of memory when it ingests documents. If the Solr server
runs out of memory, it terminates its process. To allocate more memory to the Solr server,
increase the value of the <<{managing-prefix}managed_solr_properties,`solr.mem`>> property.
