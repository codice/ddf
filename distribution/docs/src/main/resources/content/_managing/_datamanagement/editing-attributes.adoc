== {title}

For small numbers of metacards, or for metacards ingested without overrides, attributes can be edited directly.


[WARNING]
====
Metacards retrieved from connected sources or from a
fanout proxy will appear to be editable but are not truly local
so changes will not be saved.
====

. Navigate to *${catalog-ui}*.
. Search for the metacard(s) to be updated.
. Select the metacards to be updated from the results list.
. Select *Summary* or *Details*.
. Select *Actions* from the *Details* view.
. Select *Add*.
. Select attribute from the list of available attributes.
. Add any values desired for the attribute.
