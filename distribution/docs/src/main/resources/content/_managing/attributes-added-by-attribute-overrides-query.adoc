<<{managing-prefix}overriding_attributes,Attribute Overriding>> is the act of replacing existing attribute values with a new value.

Attribute overrides can be configured for query results from the following <<{managing-prefix}connecting_to_sources,Sources>>:

* <<{managing-prefix}federated_source_for_atlassian_confluence_r,Federated Source For Atlassian Confluence>>.
* <<{managing-prefix}csw_specification_profile_federated_source,CSW Specification Profile Federated Source>>.
* <<{managing-prefix}gmd_csw_source,GMD CSW Federated Source>>.

Note that the attribute must be part of the metacard's <<{integrating-prefix}metacard_type,Metacard Type>> before it can be overridden. +
See <<{managing-prefix}attributes_added_by_attribute_injection,Attributes Added By Attribute Injection>> for more information about injecting attributes into the metacard type.
