System search provide a way to execute queries with pre-defined templates and search criteria. System search forms are loaded
via the system and are read-only. This command allows an administrator to ingest, modify or remove system search forms within the system.

.Loading Forms With Defaults
----
forms:load
----

.Loading Forms With Overrides
----
forms:load --formsDirectory "/etc/forms" --forms "forms.json" --results "results.json"
----

Where: +
*-formsDirectory* Specifies the directory in which the forms JSON and XML will reside

*-results* Specifies the file name of the `results.json` file

*-forms* Specifies the file name of the `forms.json` file

It's important to note that `forms:load` will fallback to the system default location for forms, results and the forms directory. The defaults are as follows:
```
formsDirectory: "/etc/forms"
forms: "forms.json"
results: "results.json"
```

Example search forms and result form data can be found in `${home_directory}/etc/forms/readme.md`.

Managing Forms

In addition to ingesting new system forms into the system, we provide the capability to manage the forms, view the forms and remove them.

.Viewing All Forms
----
forms:manage --list
----

.Removing Single Form
----
forms:manage --remove-single "METACARD_ID"
----

.Removing All Forms
----
forms:manage --remove-all
----

Where: +
*-list* Displays the titles and IDs of all system forms in the system

*-remove-single* Takes in a metacard ID as an argument and removes it

*-remove-all* Removes all system forms from the system
