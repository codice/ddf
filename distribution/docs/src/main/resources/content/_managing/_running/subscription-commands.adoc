.subscriptions:delete Command Usage
The arguments for the `subscriptions:delete` command are the same as for the `list` command, except that a search phrase or LDAP filter must be specified.
If one of these is not specified an error will be displayed.
When the `delete` command is executed it will display each subscription ID it is deleting.
If a subscription matches the search phrase but cannot be deleted, a message in red will be displayed with the ID.
After all matching subscriptions are processed, a summary line is displayed indicating how many subscriptions were deleted out of how many matching subscriptions were found.
