== Configuring for a Highly Available Cluster

This section describes how to make configuration changes after the initial setup for a ${branding} in a <<{introduction-prefix}introduction_to_high_availability,Highly Available Cluster>>.

In a Highly Available Cluster, configuration changes must be made on both ${branding} nodes.
The changes can still be made in the standard ways via the <<{managing-prefix}admin_console_tutorial,Admin Console>>,
the <<{managing-prefix}console_command_reference,Command Line>>, or the <<{managing-prefix}configuration_files, file system>>.

[NOTE]
====
Changes made in the Admin Console must be made through the HTTP proxy.
This means that the below steps should be followed to make a change in the Admin Console:

* Make a configuration change on the currently active ${branding} node
* Shut down the active ${branding} node, making the failover proxy switch to the standby ${branding} node
* Make the same configuration change on the newly active ${branding} node
* Start the ${branding} node that was just shut down
