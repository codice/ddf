The FTP endpoint provides a method for ingesting files directly into the ${branding} Catalog using the FTP protocol
The files sent over FTP are not first written to the file system, as the <<{managing-prefix}content_directory_monitor,Directory Monitor>> does, but instead the FTP stream of the file is ingested directly into the ${branding} catalog, thus avoiding extra I/O overhead.

To install the FTP endpoint:

. Navigate to the *${admin-console}*.
. Select *System*.
. Select *Features*.
. Install the `catalog-ftp` feature.

To configure the FTP endpoint:

. Navigate to the *${admin-console}*.
. Select *System*.
. Select *Features*.
. Select *FTP Endpoint*.

See <<{reference-prefix}ddf.catalog.ftp.FtpServerManager,FTP Endpoint configurations>> for all possible configurations.
