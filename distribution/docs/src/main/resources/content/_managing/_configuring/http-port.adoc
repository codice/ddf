== {title}

To change HTTP or HTTPS ports from the default values, edit the `system.properties` file.

. Open the file at ${home_directory}/etc/system.properties
. Change the value after the `=` to the desired port number(s):
.. `org.codice.ddf.system.httpsPort=8993` to `org.codice.ddf.system.httpsPort=<PORT>`
.. `org.codice.ddf.system.httpPort=8181` to `org.codice.ddf.system.httpPort=<PORT>`
. Restart ${branding} for changes to take effect.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not use the ${admin-console} to change the HTTP port.
While the ${admin-console}'s Pax Web Runtime offers this configuration option, it has proven to be unreliable and may crash the system.
