=== Configuring Solr Encryption

While it is possible to encrypt the Solr index, it decreases performance significantly.
An encrypted Solr index also can only perform exact match queries, not relative or contextual queries.
As this drastically reduces the usefulness of the index, this configuration is not recommended.
The recommended approach is to encrypt the entire drive through the Operating System of the server
on which the index is located.
