The following sections provide hardening guidance for Solr; however, they are provided only as
reference and additional security requirements may be added.

=== Hardening Solr Server Configuration

The Solr server configuration is configured to be secure by default. No additional
hardening should be necessary. The default configuration starts Solr with TLS enabled and
basic authentication required. That means ${branding} must trust Solr's PKI certificate.

=== Solr Server Password Management

By default, ${branding} is configured to use Solr server. To verify this, view the property
<<{managing-prefix}solr_client,`solr.client`>>. If the property is set to `HttpSolrClient`,
${branding} is configured to use Solr server.

To ensure the security of its communication with Solr server, ${branding} sends HTTP requests
over TLS. Solr is configured to use basic authentication to further ensure the requests
originated from ${branding}. There are several system properties that control basic authentication
and password management.

* <<{managing-prefix}solr_usebasicauth, `solr.useBasicAuth`>>Send basic authentication header
if property is `true`
* <<{managing-prefix}solr_username,`solr.username`>>Username for basic authentication with Solr server.
* <<{managing-prefix}solr_password,`solr.password`>>Password for basic authentication.
* <<{managing-prefix}solr_autopassword,`solr.attemptAutoPasswordChange`>>
If this property is `true`, ${branding} attempts to change the default password to a randomly
generated secure password if it detects the default password is in use.
The new password is encrypted and then stored in the system properties.

The Solr distrubition included with ${branding} comes already configured with a user. To see the
username or default password, either inspect the file
`${home_directory}/etc/custom.system.properties` or refer to the properties
<<{managing-prefix}managed_solr_properties,here>>.

A limitation of the current implementation is that the Solr password is not recoverable. Further,
the migration command does not currently migrate the password. It may
be necessary to reset the password:

* After a migration.
* If the administator needs access to the Solr admin UI.
* If the administator wants to use their own password.

==== Do not Autogenerate a Solr Password

. **To prevent ${branding} from attempting to change the password** set the property
<<{managing-prefix}solr_autopassword,`solr.attemptAutoPasswordChange`>> to `false` in the
file `${home_directory}/etc/custom.system.properties`

==== Change the Password to a Specific String

[NOTE]
====
If ${branding} has generated an encrypted password, the password must be reset before
proceeding. Follow the procedure in <<_restore_the_default_password_in_solr,
Restore the Default Password in Solr>> before proceeding.
====

. To change the Solr password to a specific string, send Solr an HTTP POST request.
This is covered in the official http://lucene.apache.org/solr/resources.html[Solr documentation]
 {external-link}. Here is an example that uses the
command line utility `curl` to change the password from `admin` to `newpassword`:

 curl -k -u "admin:admin" "${secure_url}/solr/admin/authentication" -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d "{ 'set-user': {'admin' : 'newpassword'}}"
+
. Encrypt the password using the <<{integrating-prefix}encrypting_passwords,Encryption Service>>.
The encryption command enciphers the password. It is safe to save the peristed password in a file.
. Update property `solr.password` in the file ${home_directory}/etc/custom.system.properties` to
be the ouput from the encryption command. Be sure to include `ENC(` and `)` characters produced by
the encryption comand. Note that the default password is not enclosed in `ENC()` because that
is not necessary for cleartext. Cleartext is used by the system exactly as it appears.
<<_do_not_autogenerate_a_solr_password, follow these instructions>>.
. Finally, restart ${branding}

==== Restore the Default Password in Solr

. Restore the `${home_directory}/solr/server/solr/security.json` from a zip file of the
${branding} distribution.

**OR**

. Edit the `${home_directory}/solr/server/solr/security.json` file. Solr stores a salted hash of
the user passwords in this file.
. Assuming the Solr username is `admin`, change the credentials section to match
this string:
+
```
 "credentials": {
      "admin": "EjjOS/zyQ1KQQdSXFb/rFm7w6MItU5pmdthM35ZiJaA= ZZI7d4jf/8hz5oZz7ljBE6+uv1wqncj+VudX3arbib4="}
```
The quoted string following the username `admin` is the salted hash for the password `admin`.
+
. Edit the file `${home_directory}/etc/custom.system.properties` and change the value of
`solr.password` to `admin`.
. Optional: <<_do_not_autogenerate_a_solr_password, Prevent ${branding} from automatically changing the Solr password>>.

==== Removing Basic Authentication from Solr

To disable Solr's basic authentication mechanism, rename or remove the file
`${home_directory}/solr/server/solr/security.json` and restart Solr. The file `security.json`
configures Solr to use basic authetnication and defines Solr users. If the file is not present,
Solr requires no login. This could a security issue in many environments and it is recommended
to never disable Solr authentication in an operational environment. If authentication is disabled,
the system property <<{managing-prefix}solr_usebasicauth, `solr.useBasicAuth`>> may be set to
`false`.

=== Configuring Solr Encryption

While it is possible to encrypt the Solr index, it decreases performance significantly.
An encrypted Solr index also can only perform exact match queries, not relative or contextual queries.
As this drastically reduces the usefulness of the index, this configuration is not recommended.
The recommended approach is to encrypt the entire drive through the Operating System of the server
on which the index is located.
