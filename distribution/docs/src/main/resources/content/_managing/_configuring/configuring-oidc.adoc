==== {title}

To use https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html[OpenID Connect (OIDC)] and https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[OAuth 2.0],
${branding} needs to be connected to an external Identity Provider (IdP) which supports these protocols.

===== OIDC

OIDC is used to authenticate (or log in) a user. To use this protocol in ${branding}, ${branding} needs the external IdP's information.

To connect to an external IdP,

. Navigate to the *${admin-console}*.
. Select the *${ddf-security}* application.
. Select the *Configuration* tab.
. Select *OIDC Handler Configuration*.
. Populate the fields with the external IdP's information. For more detail, see the `OIDC Handler Configuration` section under <<{managing-prefix}configuring_sso,Configure Single Sign On>>.

Once connected, the Web Context Policy Manager needs to be updated. to do so,

. Under the *Configuration* tab in the *${ddf-security}* application
. Select the *Web Context Policy Manager*.
. Under `Authentication Types`, add the context type of the endpoint you wish to protect with OIDC. For example `/search=OIDC`.

===== OAuth 2.0

OAuth 2.0 is an authorization protocol and ${branding} can use it when federating.
When a user queries a source that is configured to use this protocol, ${branding} will forward the user's information (access token) with the request.
If a source can be configured to use OAuth 2.0, `OAuth 2.0` will appear as an option under `Authentication Type` in the source's configuration.

To configure a source to use OAuth 2.0, under the source's configuration,

. Change the `Authentication Type` to `OAuth 2.0`.
. Set the `OAuth Discovery Url` to the discovery URL where the OAuth provider's metadata is hosted.
. Set the `OAuth Client ID` to the ID given to ${branding} when it was registered with the OAuth provider`.
. Set the `OAuth Client Secret` to the secret given to ${branding} when it was registered with the OAuth provider`.
. Set the `OAuth Flow` to the OAuth 2.0 flow to use when federating.

[NOTE]
====
If the system ${branding} is federating with is a ${branding}, the ${branding} receiving the federated request should be connected to an external IdP and have `/services` protected by that IdP (i.e. have /service=OIDC`).
