These properties are available to be used as variable parameters in input url fields within the ${admin-console}.
For example, the url for the local csw service (\${secure_url}/services/csw) could be defined as:

[source]
----
${variable-prefix}org.codice.ddf.system.protocol}${variable-prefix}org.codice.ddf.system.hostname}:${variable-prefix}org.codice.ddf.system.port}${variable-prefix}org.codice.ddf.system.rootContext}/csw
----

This variable version is more verbose, but will not need to be changed if the system `host`, `port` or `root` context changes.

[WARNING]
====
Only root can access ports < 1024 on Unix systems.
