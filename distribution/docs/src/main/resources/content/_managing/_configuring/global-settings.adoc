Global configuration settings are configured via the properties file `custom.system.properties`.
These properties can be manually set by editing this file or set via the initial configuration from the ${admin-console}.

[NOTE]

[IMPORTANT]
====
The passwords configured in this section reflect the passwords used to decrypt JKS (Java KeyStore) files.
Changing these values without also changing the passwords of the JKS causes undesirable behavior.
