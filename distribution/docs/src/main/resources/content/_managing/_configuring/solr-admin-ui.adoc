== {title}

The Solr Admin UI for Solr server configurations is generally inaccessible through a web browser.
A web browser can be configured to access the Solr Admin UI if required.


=== Configuring a Browser to Access Solr Admin UI

The Solr server configuration is secure by default. Solr server requires a TLS connection
with client authentication. Solr only allows access to clients that present
a trusted certificate.

=== Using ${branding} Keystores

Solr server uses the same keystores as ${branding}. A simple way to enable access to the
Solr Admin UI is to install ${branding}'s own private key/certificate entry into a browser. The
method to export ${branding}'s private key/certificate entry depend on
the type of keystore being used. The method to import the private key/certificate entry
into the browser depends on the operating system, and the browser itself. For more information
consult the browser's documentation.

If the browser is not correctly configured with a
certificate that Solr trusts, the browser displays an error message about client authentication
failing, or a message that the client certificate is invalid.

=== Solr Admin UI's URL

The Solr server's URL is configured in ${branding}'s `system.properties` file. See
<<{managing-prefix}solr_server_url,solr.http.url>> for more information.
An _example_ of a typical URL for the Solr Admin UI is `https://hostname:8994`.
