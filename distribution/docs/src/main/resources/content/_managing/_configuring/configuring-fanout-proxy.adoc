(((Fanout Proxy)))

Optionally, configure ${branding} as a fanout proxy such that only queries and resource retrieval requests are processed and create/update/delete requests are rejected.
All queries are enterprise queries and no catalog provider needs to be configured.

. Navigate to the *${admin-console}*.
. Select the *${ddf-catalog}* application.
. Select the *Configuration* tab.
. Select *Catalog Standard Framework*.
. Select *Enable Fanout Proxy*.
. Save changes.

${branding} is now operating as a fanout proxy.
Only queries and resource retrieval requests are allowed.
All queries are federated.
Create, update, and delete requests are not allowed, even if a Catalog Provider was configured prior to the reconfiguration as a fanout.
