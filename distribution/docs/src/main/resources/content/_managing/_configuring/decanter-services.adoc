=== Configuring Decanter Alerting

Decanter Alerting provides a way to create alerts based on configurable conditions in events posted to `decanter/collect/*` and can be configured by editing the file `${home_directory}/etc/org.apache.karaf.decanter.alerting.service.cfg`.
By default, there is only one check that produce alerts, and it is based on the `SystemNotice` event property of `priority` of important or critical.
