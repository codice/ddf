== Java Requirements
For a runtime system:

* https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html[JRE 8 x64] {external-link} or https://openjdk.java.net/install[OpenJDK 8 JRE] {external-link} must be installed.
* The `JRE_HOME` environment variable must be set to the locations where the JRE is installed

For a development system:

* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[JDK8] must be installed.
* The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set to the location where the JDK is installed.

. Install/Upgrade to Java 8 x64 http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[J2SE 8 SDK] {external-link}
.. The recommended version is http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8u60-relnotes-2620227.html[8u60] or later.
.. Java version must contain only number values.
. Install/Upgrade to http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[JDK8] {external-link}.
. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the location where the JDK is installed.


[NOTE]
====
Prior to installing ${branding}, ensure the system time is accurate to prevent federation issues.
====

.*NIX Unset JAVA_HOME if Previously Set
[NOTE]
====
Unset `JAVA_HOME` if it is already linked to a previous version of the JRE:

`unset JAVA_HOME`
====

If JDK was installed:
====
.Setting JAVA_HOME variable
Replace `<JAVA_VERSION>` with the version and build number installed.

. Open a terminal window(*NIX) or command prompt (Windows) with administrator privileges.
. Determine Java Installation Directory (This varies between operating system versions).
+
.Find Java Path in *NIX
----
which java
----
+
.Find Java Path in Windows
The path to the JDK can vary between versions of Windows, so manually verify the path under:
+
----
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk<M.m.p_build>
----
+
. Copy path of Java installation to clipboard. (example: `/usr/java/<JAVA_VERSION`>)
. Set `JAVA_HOME` by replacing <PATH_TO_JAVA> with the copied path in this command:
+
.Setting `JAVA_HOME` on *NIX
----
JAVA_HOME=<PATH_TO_JAVA><JAVA_VERSION>
export JAVA_HOME
----
+
.Setting `JAVA_HOME` on Windows
----
set JAVA_HOME=<PATH_TO_JAVA><JAVA_VERSION>
setx JAVA_HOME "<PATH_TO_JAVA><JAVA_VERSION>"
----
+
.Adding `JAVA_HOME` to `PATH` Environment Variable on Windows
----
setx PATH "%PATH%;%JAVA_HOME%\bin"
----
+
. Restart or open up a new Terminal (shell) or Command Prompt to verify `JAVA_HOME` was set correctly. It is not necessary to restart the system for the changes to take effect.
+
.*NIX
----
echo $JAVA_HOME
----
+
.Windows
----
echo %JAVA_HOME%
----

If JRE was installed:
====
.Setting JRE_HOME variable
Replace `<JAVA_VERSION>` with the version and build number installed.

. Open a terminal window(*NIX) or command prompt (Windows) with administrator privileges.
. Determine Java Installation Directory (This varies between operating system versions).

. Copy path of Java installation to clipboard. (example: `/usr/java/<JAVA_VERSION`>)
. Set `JRE_HOME` by replacing <PATH_TO_JAVA> with the copied path in this command:

.Setting `JRE_HOME` on *NIX
----
JRE_HOME=<PATH_TO_JAVA><JAVA_VERSION>
export JRE_HOME

.Setting `JRE_HOME` on Windows
----
set JRE_HOME=<PATH_TO_JAVA><JAVA_VERSION>
setx JRE_HOME "<PATH_TO_JAVA><JAVA_VERSION>"
----

.Adding `JRE_HOME` to `PATH` Environment Variable on Windows

.File Descriptor Limit on Linux
[NOTE]
====
* For Linux systems, increase the file descriptor limit by editing `/etc/sysctl.conf` to include:

----
fs.file-max = 6815744
----

* For the change to take effect, a restart is required.

.*Nix Restart Command
----
init 6
