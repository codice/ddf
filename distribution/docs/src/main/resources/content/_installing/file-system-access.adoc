==== Controlling File System Access

Restrict access to sensitive files by ensuring that the only users with access privileges are administrators.

Within the `<${branding}_HOME>`, a directory is created named ${branding-lowercase}-${project.version}.
This directory will be referred to in the documentation as `<${branding}_HOME>`.

. Do not assume the deployment is from a trusted source; verify its origination.
. Check the available storage space on the system to ensure the deployment will not exceed the available space.
. Set maximum storage space on the `<${branding}_HOME>/deploy` and `<${branding}_HOME>/system` directories to restrict the amount of space used by deployments.

===== Setting Directory Permissions

* *{hardening-step}*

${branding} relies on the Directory Permissions of the host platform to protect the integrity of the ${branding} during operation.
System administrators MUST perform the following steps prior to deploying bundles added to the ${branding}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The system administrator must restrict certain directories to ensure that the application (user) cannot access restricted directories on the system.
For example the `${branding}_USER` should have read-only access to `<${branding}_HOME>`, except for the sub-directories `etc`, `data`, `solr` and `instances`.
====

.Setting Directory Permissions on Windows
****
Set directory permissions on the `<${branding}_HOME>`; all sub-directories except `etc`, `data`, and `instances`; and any directory intended to interact with the ${branding} to protect from unauthorized access.

. Right-click on the `<${branding}_HOME>` directory.
. Select *Properties -> Security -> Advanced*.
. Under *Owner*, select *Change*.
. Enter `Creator Owner` into the *Enter the Object Name...* field.
. Select *Check Names*.
. Select *Apply*.
.. If prompted *Do you wish to continue*, select *Yes*.
. Remove all Permission Entries for any groups or users with access to <${branding}_HOME> other than *System*, *Administrators*, and *Creator Owner*.
.. Note: If prompted with a message such as: *You canâ€™t remove X because this object is inheriting permissions from its parent.* when removing entries from the Permission entries table:
... Select *Disable Inheritance*.
... Select *Convert Inherited Permissions into explicit permissions on this object*.
... Try removing the entry again.
. Select the option for *Replace all child object permission entries with inheritable permission entries from this object*.
. Close the *Advanced Security Settings* window.

.Setting Directory Permissions on *NIX
****
Set directory permissions to protect the ${branding} from unauthorized access.

* Change ownership of `<${branding}_HOME>`
** `chown -R ${branding-lowercase}-user <${branding}_HOME>`
* Create instances sub-directory if does not exist
** `mkdir -p <${branding}_HOME>/instances <${branding}_HOME>/solr`
* Change group ownership on sub-directories
** `chgrp -R ${branding}_GROUP <${branding}_HOME>/etc <${branding}_HOME>/data <${branding}_HOME>/instances <${branding}_HOME>/solr`
* Change group permissions
** `chmod -R g-w <${branding}_HOME>/etc <${branding}_HOME>/data <${branding}_HOME>/instances <${branding}_HOME>/solr`
* Remove permissions for other users
** `chmod -R o-rwx <${branding}_HOME>/etc <${branding}_HOME>/data <${branding}_HOME>/instances`
