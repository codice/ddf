:summary: Adds a policy if Point of Contact is updated.

The Point of Contact Policy Plugin is a PreUpdate plugin that will check if the point-of-contact attribute has changed.
If it does, then it adds a policy to that metacardâ€™s policy map that cannot be implied.
This will deny such an update request, which essentially makes the point-of-contact attribute read-only.
