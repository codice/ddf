=== Documentation Conventions

The following conventions are used within this documentation:

==== Customizable Values

Many values used in descriptions are customizable and should be changed for specific use cases.
These values are denoted by `< >`, and by `[[ ]]` when within XML syntax. When using a real value, the placeholder characters should be omitted.

==== Code Values

Java objects, lines of code, or file properties are denoted with the `Monospace` font style.
Example: `ddf.catalog.CatalogFramework`

==== Hyperlinks

Some hyperlinks (e.g., `/admin`) within the documentation assume a locally running installation of ${ddf-branding}. 
Simply change the hostname if accessing a remote host.
