In ${branding}, <<_introduction_to_resources,resources>> are the files, reports, or documents of interest to users of the system.

Metadata is information about those resources, organized into a schema to make search possible.
The ${ddf-catalog} stores this metadata and allows access to it.
Metacards are single instances of metadata, representing a single resource, in the Catalog.
Metacards follow one of several schemas to ensure reliable, accurate, and complete metadata.
Essentially, Metacards function as containers of metadata.
