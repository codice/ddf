${branding} can be made highly available. In this context, High Availability is defined as the ability for ${branding} to be continuously operational with very little down time.

In a Highly Available Cluster, ${branding} has failover capabilities when a ${branding} node fails.

[NOTE]
====
The word "node", from a High Availability perspective, is one of the two ${branding} systems running within the Highly Available Cluster.
Though there are multiple systems running with the Highly Available Cluster, it is still considered a single ${branding} from a user's
perspective or from other ${branding}s' perspectives.
====

This setup consists of a Solr Cloud instance, 2 ${branding} nodes connected to that Solr Cloud, and a failover proxy that sits in front of those 2 nodes.
One of the ${branding} nodes will be arbitrarily chosen to be the active node, and the other will be the "hot standby" node.
It is called a "hot standby" node because it is ready to receive traffic even though it's not currently receiving any.
The failover proxy will route all traffic to the active node.
If the active node fails for any reason, the standby node will become active and the failover proxy will route all traffic to the new active node.
See the below diagrams for more detail.

There are special procedures for initial setup and configuration of a highly available ${branding}. See <<{managing-prefix}high_availability_initial_setup,High Availability Initial Setup>> and <<{managing-prefix}configuring_for_a_highly_available_cluster,High Availability Configuration>> for those procedures.
