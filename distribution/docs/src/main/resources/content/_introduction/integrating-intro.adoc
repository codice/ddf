:summary: Introduction to Integrating sections.

${branding} is structured to enable flexible integration with external clients and into larger component systems.

Federation with ${branding} is primarily accomplished through <<{integrating-prefix}endpoints,Endpoints>> accessible through http(s) requests and responses.

If integrating with an existing installation of ${branding}, continue to the following sections on endpoints and data/metadata management.

If a new installation of ${branding} is required, first see the <<{managing-prefix}managing,Managing>> section for installation and configuration instructions, then return to this section for guidance on connecting external clients.

If you would like to set up a test or demo installation to use while developing an external client, see the <<{quickstart-prefix}quick_start_tutorial,Quick Start Tutorial>> for demo instructions.

For troubleshooting and known issues, see the {release-notes-url}[Release Notes] {external-link}.
