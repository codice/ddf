This document assumes familiarity with the XACML schema and does not go into detail on the XACML language.
When creating a policy, a target is used to indicate that a certain action should be run only for one type of request.
Targets can be used on both the main policy element and any individual rules.
Targets are geared toward the actions that are set in the request.
These actions generally consist of the standard CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) or a SOAPAction if the request is coming through a SOAP endpoint.

[NOTE]
====
These are only the action values that are currently created by the components that come with ${branding}.
Additional components can be created and added to ${branding} to identify specific actions.
====

In the examples below, the policy has specified targets for the above type of calls.
For the Filtering code, the target was set for "filter", and the Service validation code targets were geared toward two services: `query` and `LocalSiteName`.
In a production environment, these actions for service authorization will generally be full URNs that are described within the SOAP WSDL.

==== XACML Policy Attributes

Attributes for the XACML request are populated with the information in the calling subject and the resource being checked.

==== XACML Policy Subject

The attributes for the subject are obtained from the SAML claims and populated within the XACML policy as individual attributes under the `urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:subject-category:access-subject` category.
The name of the claim is used for the `AttributeId` value.
Examples of the items being populated are available at the end of this page.

==== XACML Policy Resource

The attributes for resources are obtained through the permissions process.
When checking permissions, the XACML processing engine retrieves a list of permissions that should be checked against the subject.
These permissions are populated outside of the engine and should be populated with the attributes that should be asserted against the subject.
When the permissions are of a key-value type, the key being used is populated as the AttributeId value under the urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-category:resource category.

==== Using a XACML Policy

To use a XACML policy, copy the XACML policy into the `${home_directory}/etc/pdp/policies` directory.
