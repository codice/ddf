:summary: Creating a custom token validator.
:order: 12

Token validators are used by the Security Token Service (STS) to validate incoming token requests.
The `TokenValidator` CXF interface must be implemented by all custom token validators.
The `canHandleToken` and `validateToken` methods must be overridden.
The `canHandleToken` method should return true or false based on the `ValueType` value of the token that the validator is associated with.
The validator may be able to handle any number of different tokens that you specify.
The `validateToken` method returns a `TokenValidatorResponse` object that contains the `Principal` of the identity being validated and also validates the `ReceivedToken` object collected from the RST (`RequestSecurityToken`) message.
