${branding} documentation is included in the source code, so it is edited and maintained in much the same way.

==== Editing Existing Documentation

Update existing content when code behavior changes, new capabilities are added to features, or the configuration process changes.
Content is organized within the `content` directory in sub directories according to the audience and purpose for each document in the documentation library.
Use this list to determine placement of new content.

.Documentation Sections
Introduction/Core Concepts:: This section is intended to be a high-level, executive summary of the features and capabilities of ${branding}. Content here should be written at a non-technical level.

Quick Start:: This section is intended for getting set up with a test, demonstration, or trial instance of ${branding}. This is the place for non-production shortcuts or workarounds that would not be used in a secured, hardened installation.

Managing:: The managing section covers "how-to" instructions to be used to install, configure, and maintain an instance of ${branding} in a production environment. This content should be aimed at system administrators. Security hardening should be integrated into these sections.

Using:: This section is primarily aimed at the final end users who will be performing tasks with ${branding}. This content should guide users through common tasks and user interfaces.

Integrating:: This section guides developers building other projects looking to connect to new or existing instances of ${branding}.

Developing:: This section provides guidance and best practices on developing custom implementations of ${branding} components, especially ones that may be contributed into the code baseline.

Architecture:: This section is a detailed description of the architectural design of ${branding} and how components work together.

Reference:: This section is a comprehensive list of features and possible configurations.

Metadata Reference:: This section details how metadata is extracted and normalized by ${branding}.

Documentation:: This is a collection of all of the individual documentation pages in one html or pdf file.

See the https://codice.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DDF/pages/6291516/Documentation+Style+Guide[style guide] for more guidance on stylistic and formatting concerns.

==== Adding New Documentation Content

If creating a new section is required, there are some minimal requirements for a new `.adoc` file.

.Header content
The templates scan the header information to place it into the correct place within the documentation.
Different sections have different headers required, but some common attributes are always required.

* `type`: roughly maps to the section or subSection of the documentation.
* `title`: title of the section or subsection contained in the file.
* `status`: set to `published` to include within the documentation, set to `draft` to hide a work-in-progress section.
* `order`: used in sections where order needs to be enforced.
* `summary`: brief summary of section contents. Some, but not all, summaries are included by templates.

==== Creating a New Documentation Template

To create a new, standalone documentation page, create a new template in the `templates` directory.
Optionally, this template can `include` some of the internal templates in the `templates/build` directory, but this is not required.

For guidance on using the freemarker syntax, see the https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/ref.html[Freemarker documentation].

==== Extending Documentation in Downstream Distributions

By mimicking the build and directory structure of the documentation, downstream projects are able to leverage the existing documentation and insert content before and after sections of the ${branding} documentation.

.Documentation Module Directory Structure
[source]
----
-docs
  -src
    -main
      -resources
        -content
        -images
        -templates
----

`content`:: Contains the .adoc files that make up the content.
Sub-directories are organized according to the documents that make up the main library.
`images`:: any pre-existing images, such as screenshots, to be included in the documentation.
`templates`:: template files used to create documentation artifacts.
A `build` sub-directory holds the templates that will not be standalone documents to render specific sections.
