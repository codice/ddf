:summary: Assuring Authenticity of Bundles and Applications.

${branding} Artifacts in the JAR file format (such as bundles or ${branding} applications packaged as KAR files) can be signed and verified using the tools included as part of the Java Runtime Environment.

==== Prerequisites

To work with Java signatures, a keystore/truststore is required.
For testing or trial purposes ${branding} can sign and validate using a self-signed certificate, generated with the keytool utility.
In an actuall installation, a certificate issued from a trusted Certificate Authority will be used.

Additional documentation on keytool can be found at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/windows/keytool.html[Keytool home].

==== Signing a JAR/KAR

Once a keystore is available, the JAR can be signed using the `jarsigner`
 tool.

Additional documentation on jarsigner can be found at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/windows/jarsigner.html[Jarsigner].

===== Verifying a JAR/KAR
The jarsigner utility is also used to verify a signature in a JAR-formatted file.

  s = signature was verified
  m = entry is listed in manifest
  k = at least one certificate was found in keystore
  i = at least one certificate was found in identity scope
jar verified.

Note the last line: _jar verified_.
This indicates that the signatures used to sign the JAR (or in this case, KAR) were valid according to the trust relationships specified by the keystore.
