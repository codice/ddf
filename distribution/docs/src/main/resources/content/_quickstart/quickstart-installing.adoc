These are the basic requirements to set up the environment to run a ${branding}.

[WARNING]
====
For security reasons, ${branding} cannot be started from a user's home directory. If attempted, the system will automatically shut down.
====

=== Quick Install Prerequisites
.Hardware Requirements (Quick Install)
* At least 4096MB of memory for ${branding}.
** This amount can be increased to support memory-intensive applications. See <<{managing-prefix}jvm_memory_configuration, Memory Considerations>>.

.Java Requirements (Quick Install)

Follow the instructions outlined here: <<{managing-prefix}java_requirements, Java Requirements>>.

.Check System Time
[WARNING]
====
Prior to installing ${branding}, ensure the system time is accurate to prevent federation issues.
====

=== Quick Install of ${branding}

. Download the ${branding} {download-url}[zip file] {external-link}.
. Install ${branding} by unzipping the zip file.
+
.Windows Zip Utility Warning
[WARNING]
====
The Windows Zip implementation, which is invoked when a user double-clicks on a zip file in the Windows Explorer, creates a corrupted installation.
This is a consequence of its inability to process long file paths.
Instead, use the java jar command line utility to unzip the distribution (see example below) or use a third party utility such as 7-Zip.

Note: If and only if a JDK is installed, the jar command may be used; otherwise, another archiving utility that does not have issue with long paths should be installed

.Use Java to Unzip in Windows(Replace `<PATH_TO_JAVA>` with correct path `and <JAVA_VERSION>` with current version.)
----
"<PATH_TO_JAVA>\jdk<JAVA_VERSION>\bin\jar.exe" xf ${branding-lowercase}-${project.version}.zip

. This will create an installation directory, which is typically created with the name and version of the application.
This installation directory will be referred to as `${home_directory}`.
(Substitute the actual directory name.)
. Start ${branding} by running the `${home_directory}/bin/${branding-lowercase}` script (or `${branding-lowercase}.bat` on Windows).
. Startup may take a few minutes.
.. Optionally, a `system:wait-for-ready` command (aliased to `wfr`) can be used to wait for startup to complete.
. The ${command-console} will display.

.${command-console} Prompt

=== Quick Install of ${branding} on a remote headless server

If ${branding} is being installed on a remote server that has no user interface, the hostname will need to be updated in the configuration files and certificates.

[NOTE]
====
Do not replace _all_ instances of `localhost`, only those specified.
====

.Configuring with a new hostname
. Update the ${home_directory}/etc/custom.system.properties file. The entry `org.codice.ddf.system.hostname=localhost` should be updated to `org.codice.ddf.system.hostname=<HOSTNAME>`.
. Update the ${home_directory}/etc/users.properties file. Change the `localhost=localhost[...]` entry to <HOSTNAME>=<HOSTNAME>. (Keep the rest of the line as is.)
. Update the ${home_directory}/etc/users.attributes file. Change the "localhost" entry to "<HOSTNAME>".
. From the console go to ${home_directory}/etc/certs and run the appropriate script.
.. *NIX: `sh CertNew.sh -cn <hostname> -san "DNS:<hostname>"`.
.. Windows: `CertNew -cn <hostname> -san "DNS:<hostname>"`.
. Proceed with starting the system and continue as usual.

.Configuring with an IP address
. Update the ${home_directory}/etc/custom.system.properties file. The entry `org.codice.ddf.system.hostname=localhost` should be updated to `org.codice.ddf.system.hostname=<IP>`.
. Update the ${home_directory}/etc/users.properties file. Change the `localhost=localhost[...]` entry to <IP>=<IP>. (Keep the rest of the line as is.)
. Update the ${home_directory}/etc/users.attributes file. Change the "localhost" entry to "<IP>".
. From the console go to ${home_directory}/etc/certs and run the appropriate script.
.. *NIX: `sh CertNew.sh -cn <IP> -san "IP:<IP>"`.
.. Windows: `CertNew -cn <IP> -san "IP:<IP>"`.
. Proceed with starting the system and continue as usual.


.File Descriptor Limit on Linux
[NOTE]
====
* For Linux systems, increase the file descriptor limit by editing `/etc/sysctl.conf` to include:

----
fs.file-max = 6815744
----

* (This file may need permissions changed to allow write access).
* For the change to take effect, a restart is required.

. *nix Restart Command
----
init 6
