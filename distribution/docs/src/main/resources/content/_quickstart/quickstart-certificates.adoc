== Certificates (Quick Start)

${branding} comes with a default keystore that contains certificates.
This allows the distribution to be unzipped and run immediately.
If these certificates are sufficient for testing purposes, proceed to <<{quickstart-prefix}configuring_quick_start,Configuring (Quick Start)>>.

To test federation using 2-way TLS, the default keystore certificates will need to be replaced, using either the included <<{quickstart-prefix}demo_certificate_authority_ca,Demo Certificate Authority>> or by <<{quickstart-prefix}creating_self_signed_certificates,Creating Self-signed Certificates>>.

If the installer was used to install the ${branding} and a hostname other than "localhost" was given, the user will be prompted to upload new trust/key stores.

If the hostname is `localhost` or, if the hostname was changed _after_ installation, the default certificates will not allow access to the ${branding} instance from another machine over HTTPS (now the default for many services).
The Demo Certificate Authority will need to be replaced with certificates that use the fully-qualified hostname of the server running the ${branding} instance.

=== Demo Certificate Authority (CA)

${branding} comes with a populated truststore containing entries for many public certificate authorities, such as Go Daddy and Verisign.
It also includes an entry for the ${ddf-branding} Demo Root CA.
This entry is a self-signed certificate used for testing.
It enables ${branding} to run immediately after unzipping the distribution.
The keys and certificates for the ${ddf-branding} Demo Root CA are included as part of the ${branding} distribution.
This entry must be removed from the truststore before ${branding} can operate securely.

==== Creating New Server Keystore Entry with the CertNew Scripts

To create a private key and certificate signed by the Demo Certificate Authority, use the provided scripts.
To use the scripts, run them out of the `${home_directory}/etc/certs` directory.


.*NIX Demo CA Script
****

For *NIX, use the `CertNew.sh` script.

`sh CertNew.sh [-cn <cn>|-dn <dn>] [-san <tag:name,tag:name,...>]`

where:

* `<cn>` represents a fully qualified common name (e.g. "<FQDN>", where <FQDN> could be something like cluster.yoyo.com)
* `<dn>` represents a distinguished name as a comma-delimited string (e.g. "c=US, st=California, o=Yoyodyne, l=San Narciso, cn=<FQDN>")
* `<tag:name,tag:name,...>` represents optional subject alternative names to be added to the generated certificate (e.g. "DNS:<FQDN>,DNS:node1.<FQDN>,DNS:node2.<FQDN>"). The format for subject alternative names is similar to the OpenSSL X509 configuration format. Supported tags are:
** `email` - email subject
** `URI` - uniformed resource identifier
** `RID` - registered id
** `DNS` - hostname
** `IP` - ip address (V4 or V6)
** `dirName` - directory name

If no arguments specified on the command line, `hostname -f` is used as the common-name for the certificate.
****

.Windows Demo CA Script
****
For Windows, use the `CertNew.cmd` script.

`CertNew (-cn <cn>|-dn <dn>) [-san "<tag:name,tag:name,...>"]`

where:

* `<cn>` represents a fully qualified common name (e.g. "<FQDN>", where <FQDN> could be something like cluster.yoyo.com)
* `<dn>` represents a distinguished name as a comma-delimited string (e.g. "c=US, st=California, o=Yoyodyne, l=San Narciso, cn=<FQDN>")
* `<tag:name,tag:name,...>` represents optional subject alternative names to be added to the generated certificate (e.g. "DNS:<FQDN>,DNS:node1.<FQDN>,DNS:node2.<FQDN>"). The format for subject alternative names is similar to the OpenSSL X509 configuration format. Supported tags are:
** `email` - email subject
** `URI` - uniformed resource identifier
** `RID` - registered id
** `DNS` - hostname
** `IP` - ip address (V4 or V6)
** `dirName` - directory name
****

The `CertNew` scripts:

* Create a new entry in the server keystore.
* Use the hostname as the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) when creating the certificate.
* Adds the specified subject alternative names if any.
* Use the Demo Certificate Authority to sign the certificate so that it will be trusted by the default configuration.

To install a certificate signed by a different Certificate Authority, see <<{managing-prefix}managing_keystores,Managing Keystores>>.

After this proceed to <<{quickstart-prefix}updating_settings_after_changing_certificates,Updating Settings After Changing Certificates>>.

[WARNING]
====
If the server's fully qualified domain name is not recognized, the name may need to be added to the network's DNS server.
====

==== Dealing with Lack of DNS

In some cases DNS may not be available and the system will need to be configured to work with IP addresses.

Options can be given to the CertNew Scripts to generate certs that will work in this scenario.

.*NIX
****
From ${home_directory}/etc/certs/ run:

`sh CertNew.sh -cn <IP> -san "IP:<IP>"`
****

.Windows
****
From ${home_directory}/etc/certs/ run:

`CertNew -cn <IP> -san "IP:<IP>"`
****

After this proceed to <<{quickstart-prefix}updating_settings_after_changing_certificates,Updating Settings After Changing Certificates>>, and be sure to use the IP address instead of the FQDN.

=== Creating Self-Signed Certificates

If using the Demo CA is not desired, ${branding} supports creating self-signed certificates with a self-signed certificate authority.
This is considered an advanced configuration.

Creating self-signed certificates involves creating and configuring the files that contain the certificates.
In ${branding}, these files are generally Java Keystores (`jks`) and Certificate Revocation Lists (`crl`).
This includes commands and tools that can be used to perform these operations.

For this example, the following tools are used:

* openssl
** Windows users can use: https://code.google.com/p/openssl-for-windows/downloads/detail?name=openssl-0.9.8k_X64.zip&can=2&q=[openssl] for windows.
* The standard Java https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/keytool.html[keytool certificate management utility] {external-link}.
* http://portecle.sourceforge.net/[Portecle] can be used for *keytool* operations if a GUI if preferred over a command line interface.

==== Creating a custom CA Key and Certificate

The following steps demonstrate creating a root CA to sign certificates.

. Create a key pair. +
`$> openssl genrsa -aes128 -out root-ca.key 1024` +
. Use the key to sign the CA certificate. +
`$> openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -key root-ca.key -out root-ca.crt`

==== Sign Certificates Using the custom CA

The following steps demonstrate signing a certificate for the `tokenissuer` user by a CA.

. Generate a private key and a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). +
`$> openssl req -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout tokenissuer.key -out tokenissuer.req`
. Sign the certificate by the CA. +
`$> openssl ca -out tokenissuer.crt -infiles tokenissuer.req`

These certificates will be used during system configuration to replace the default certificates.

=== Updating Settings After Changing Certificates

After changing the certificates it will be necessary to update the system user and the `org.codice.ddf.system.hostname` property with the value of either the FQDN or the IP.

FQDNs should be used wherever possible. In the absence of DNS, however, IP addresses can be used.

Replace `localhost` with the FQDN or the IP in `${home_directory}/etc/users.properties`, `${home_directory}/etc/users.attributes`, and `${home_directory}/etc/custom.system.properties`.

[TIP]
====
On linux this can be accomplished with a single command:
`sed -i 's/localhost/<FQDN|IP>/g' ${home_directory}/etc/users.* ${home_directory}/etc/custom.system.properties`
====

Finally, restart the ${branding} instance. Navigate to the ${admin-console} to test changes.
