Custom endpoints can be created, if necessary.
See <<{integrating-prefix}endpoint_details,Endpoints>> for descriptions of provided endpoints.

Complete the following procedure to create an endpoint. 

. Create a Java class that implements the endpoint's business logic. Example: Creating a web service that external clients can invoke.

. Add the endpoint's business logic, invoking `CatalogFramework` calls as needed.  

. Import the ${branding} packages to the bundle's manifest for run-time (in addition to any other required packages): +
`Import-Package: ddf.catalog, ddf.catalog.*`

. Retrieve an instance of `CatalogFramework` from the OSGi registry. (Refer to <<{developing-prefix}osgi_basics,OSGi Basics - Service Registry>> for examples.)

. Deploy the packaged service to ${branding}.
(Refer to <<{developing-prefix}osgi_basics,OSGi Basics - Bundles>>.)

[NOTE]
====
It is recommended to use the maven bundle plugin to create the Endpoint bundle's manifest as opposed to directly editing the manifest file.
====

[TIP]
====
*No implementation of an interface is required* +
Unlike other ${branding} components that require you to implement a standard interface, no implementation of an interface is required in order to create an endpoint.
