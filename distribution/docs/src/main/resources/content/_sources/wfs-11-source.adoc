== {title}

The WFS Source allows for requests for geographical features across the web using platform-independent calls.

A Web Feature Service (WFS) source is an implementation of the `FederatedSource` interface provided by the ${branding} Framework.

Use the WFS Source if querying a WFS version 1.1.0 compliant service.

.Installing the WFS v1.1.0 Source
The WFS v1.1.0 Source is installed by default with a standard installation in the ${ddf-spatial} application.

Configure a new WFS v1.1.0 Source through the ${admin-console}:

* Navigate to the *${admin-console}*.
* Select the *${ddf-catalog}* application.
* Select the *Sources* tab.
* Add a New source.
* Name the New source.
* Select *WFS v1.1.0 Source* from *Binding Configurations*.

.Configuring the WFS v1.1.0 Source
Configure an existing WFS v1.1.0 Source through the ${admin-console}:

* Navigate to the *${admin-console}*.
* Select the *${ddf-catalog}* application.
* Select the *Sources* tab.
* Select the name of the source to edit.

See <<{reference-prefix}Wfs_v1_1_0_Federated_Source,WFS v.1.1 Federated Source configurations>> for all possible configurations.

.WFS URL
The WFS URL must match the endpoint for the service being used.
The type of service and version are added automatically, so they do not need to be included.
Some servers will throw an exception if they are included twice, so do not include those.

The syntax depends on the server.
However, in most cases, the syntax will be everything before the `?` character in the URL that corresponds to the `GetCapabilities` query.

.Example GeoServer 2.12.1 Syntax
----
http://www.example.org:8080/geoserver/wfs?service=wfs&version=1.1.0&request=GetCapabilities
----

In this case, the WFS URL would be: `http://www.example.org:8080/geoserver/wfs`
