== {title}

The Solr Catalog Provider is included with a standard installation of ${branding}. There are several configurations available:

.[[_internal_solr]]Internally Managed Solr Server (default):: ${branding} comes bundled with a customized distribution
of Apache Solr. This Solr distribution includes the configuration files needed for
the Solr cores and special JAR libraries used by ${branding}.
This installation is referred to as _internally managed_
because the ${branding} scripts attempt to start and stop this Solr server.
Considerations include:

* No configuration necessary. Simply start ${branding} and ${branding} manages starting and
stopping the Solr server.
* Backup can be performed using ${branding} console's `backup` command.
* This configuration cannot be scaled larger than the single Solr server.
* All data is located inside the {$branding} home directory. If the Solr index grows
  large, the storage volume may run low on space.

.Installing Internally Managed Solr
No installation is required because ${branding} includes a distribution of Apache Solr.

.Configuring Internally Managed Solr
Although the default settings should be sufficient for most purposes, some options
can be configured for an internally managed Solr.

.Enabling Remote Requests
Solr is configured to reject all remote requests by default. It is only accessible locally.
This is a necessary part of a secure configuration.

It might be necessary to enable remote requests when troubleshooting a ${branding} installation.
To enabled remote requests:

. For *NIX systems, edit the file `${home_directory}/bin/ddf`
. Change the property `SOLR_REQUIRE_TWO_WAY_TLS` to `SOLR_REQUIRE_TWO_WAY_TLS=false`
. Restart ${branding}

.Configuring Solr Transport Layer Security
The default configuration does not use
Transport Layer Security (TLS) between ${branding} and Solr. TLS adds overhead to Solr interactions
and should not be necessary because Solr and ${branding} are running on the same host.
To enable TLS:

. Edit the `${home_directory}/etc/system.properties`
. Change the property `solr.http.url` to read `https://` instead of `http://`
. Restart ${branding}

.Require Two-way (Client) Authentication
This option is only meaningful if Solr and ${branding} communicate via the HTTPS protocol.
The default configuration is secure and requires client authentication
if the HTTPS protocol is used.

Two-way authentication means the server (Solr) must trust the client (${branding}). If Solr
did not trust ${branding}, Solr would reject all requests
from ${branding} and all other the unauthenticated clients. Internally managed Solr and
${branding} share the same key store and trust store, and therefore trust each other implicitly.
However, web browsers that do not present a certificate that ${branding} trusts are not
permitted to connect directly to the Solr server. In this situation, the browser displays the message
 `ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR`

It might be necessary to disable client authentication when troubleshooting a ${branding} installation.
To disable client authentication:

. For *NIX systems, edit the file `${home_directory}/bin/ddf`
. Change the property `SOLR_REQUIRE_TWO_WAY_TLS` to `SOLR_REQUIRE_TWO_WAY_TLS=false`
. Restart ${branding}

.Internally Managed Solr Server System Properties (default values)
 ----
 solr.client=HttpSolrClient
 solr.http.port=8994
 solr.http.url=http://localhost:${solr.http.port}/solr
 solr.managed=true
 ----

.[[_external_solr]]Externally Managed Solr Server:: In this configuration, ${branding} communicates with a
Solr server that is started, stopped, and otherwise administrated independently of ${branding}.
Some considerations of this configuration are:

* The externally managed Solr server can be located on any host. ${branding} uses
 HTTP/HTTPS to communicate with a remote Solr server.
* An administrator is responsible for managing lifecycle of the Solr server.
* Security considerations when communicating over a network.
* Possible performance issues because of network latency and bandwidth.

.Installing Externally Managed Solr
To install a  Solr server, refer to
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Apache+Solr+Reference+Guide[Apache Solr Reference Guide].

.Configuring ${branding} For Externally Managed Solr
. Edit the `${home_directory}/etc/system.properties`
.. Change the property `solr.http.port` to the port used by the Solr server
.. Change the property `solr.http.url` to the URL used by the Solr server. Remember to use
`${solr.http.port}` to specify the port,
.. Change the property `solr.managed` to *false*, or remove the property entirely.
. Two additional JAR files need to be added to the Solr installation as described in
 <<Installing Solr Cloud,Installing Solr Cloud>>

.Externally Managed Solr Server System Properties (example values)
----
solr.client=HttpSolrClient
solr.http.port=8983
solr.http.url=https://host:${solr.http.port}/solr
----

.[[_solr_cloud]]Solr Cloud:: Solr Cloud is a cluster of distributed Solr servers used for high
availability and scalability. If the ${branding} needs to be available with little or no downtime,
 then the Solr Cloud configuration should be used. The general considerations for selecting
  this configuration are:

 * SolrCloud can scale to support over 2 billion indexed documents.
 * Has network overhead and requires additional protection to be secure.
 * Installation is more involved (requires Zookeeper)
 * Configuration and administration is more complex due to replicate, sharding, etc.
 * No way to backup currently, but will automatically recover from system failure.

Configuration shared between Solr Server instances is managed by Zookeeper.
Zookeeper helps manage the overall structure.

[NOTE]
====
Solr Cloud is currently in Beta version.
Bugs and feature changes may affect the final release.
====

[NOTE]
====
The instructions on setting up Solr Cloud for ${branding} only include setup in a *NIX environment.
====

.Solr Cloud Prerequisites
Before Solr Cloud can be installed:

* ZooKeeper 3.4.5 (Refer to https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.1.2/zookeeperStarted.html#sc_Download for installation instructions.)
* *NIX environment
* JDK 8 or greater

[NOTE]
====
A minimum of three Zookeeper nodes required.
Three Zookeeper nodes are needed to form a quorum.
A three Zookeeper ensemble allows for a single server to fail and the service will still be available.
More Zookeeper nodes can be added to achieve greater fault tolerance. The total number of nodes must always be an odd number.
See https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/6_6/setting-up-an-external-zookeeper-ensemble.html#SettingUpanExternalZooKeeperEnsemble-SettingupaZooKeeperEnsemble[
Setting Up an External Zoo Keeper Ensemble] for more information.
====

.Installing Solr Cloud

Before starting the install procedure, download the extension jars. The jars are needed to support
geospatial and xpath queries and need to be installed on every Solr server instance after the Solr
Cloud installation instructions have been followed.

The JARs can be found here:

.. http://artifacts.codice.org/service/local/repositories/releases/content/org/codice/thirdparty/jts/1.12_1/jts-1.12_1.jar
.. http://artifacts.codice.org/service/local/artifact/maven/content?r=public&g=ddf.platform.solr&a=solr-xpath&v=${ddf.version}

Repeat the following procedure for each Solr server instance that will be part of the Solr Cloud cluster:

. Refer to https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Apache+Solr+Reference+Guide for installation instructions.
. Copy downloaded jar files to: `<SOLR_INSTALL_DIR>/server/solr-webapp/webapp/WEB-INF/lib/`

[NOTE]
====
A minimum of two Solr server instances is required. Each Solr server instance must have a minimum of two shards.
Having two Solr server instances guarantees that at least one Solr server is available if one fails.
The two shards enables the document mapping to be restored if one shard becomes unavailable.
====

.Configuring Solr Cloud
. On the ${branding} server, edit `${home_directory}/etc/system.properties`:
.. Comment out the Solr Client Configuration for *Http Solr Client* section.
.. Uncomment the section for the *Cloud Solr Client*:
.. Set `solr.cloud.zookeeper` to `<ZOOKEEPER_1_HOSTNAME>:<PORT_NUMBER>`, `<ZOOKEEPER_2_HOSTNAME>:<PORT_NUMBER>`, `<ZOOKEEPER_n_HOSTNAME>:<PORT_NUMBER>`
.. Set `solr.data.dir` to the desired data directory.

.Solr Cloud System Properties
----
solr.client = CloudSolrClient
solr.data.dir = ${karaf.home}/data/solr
solr.cloud.zookeeper = zk1:2181,zk2:2181,zk3:2181
