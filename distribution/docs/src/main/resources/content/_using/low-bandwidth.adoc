Low bandwidth mode can be enabled by passing in a `?lowBandwidth` parameter along with any URL targeting the ${catalog-ui} endpoint.
Ex: `${secure_url}/search/catalog/?lowBandwidth#workspaces`.
Currently, enabling this parameter causes the system to prompt the user for confirmation before loading potentially bandwidth-intensive components like the 2D or 3D Maps.
