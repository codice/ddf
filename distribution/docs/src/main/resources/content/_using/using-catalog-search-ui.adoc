[[_text_search_details]]Text Search Details:: Searches across all textual data of the targeted data source.
Text search capabilities include:
+
Search for an exact word, such as `Text = apple` : Returns items containing the word "apple" but not "apples". Matching occurs on word boundaries.

+
*Any*: Search without any time restrictions (default).

* *Advanced*: Advanced query builder to create more specific searches.
+
[[_advanced_query_builder_details]]Advanced Query Builder Details:: *Operator*: If 'AND' is used, all the filters in the branch have to be true for this branch to be true. If 'OR' is used, only one of the filters in this branch has to be true for this branch to be true.

.Intersecting Polygon Searchs
[NOTE]
====
If a self intersecting polygon is used to perform a geographic search, the polygon will be converted into a non-intersection one via a convex hull conversion. In the example below the blue line shows the original self intersecting search polygon and the red line shows the converted polygon that will be used for the search. The blue dot shows a search result that was not within the original polygon but was returned because it was within the converted polygon.
