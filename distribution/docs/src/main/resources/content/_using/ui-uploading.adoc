Files are processed individually with a visual status indication of each upload.

=== Using the Upload Editor
${catalog-ui} provides an upload editor form which allows users to customize the metadata of their
uploads. If enabled, it will appear alongside the upload dropzone and will displays a list of
attributes a that may be set.

To set an attribute, simply provide a value in the corresponding form control. All custom values in
the form will be applied on upload. If a field is left blank, the attribute will be ignored. To
remove all custom values entered, simply click the "Reset Attributes" button at the bottom of the
form.

Certain attributes within the form may be marked as required (indicated by an asterisk). These
fields must be set before uploads will be permitted.
