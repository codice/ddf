${catalog-ui} provides an ((Attribute Editor)) form which allows users to customize the metadata of their uploads.
If enabled, it will appear alongside the upload dropzone and will display a list of attributes that may be set.

To set an attribute, simply provide a value in the corresponding form control.
All custom values in the form will be applied on upload.
If a field is left blank, the attribute will be ignored.
To remove all custom values entered, simply click the "Reset Attributes" button at the bottom of the
form.

Certain attributes within the form may be marked as required (indicated by an asterisk).
These fields must be set before uploads will be permitted.
