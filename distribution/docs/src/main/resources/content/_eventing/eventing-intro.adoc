The Eventing capability of the Catalog allows endpoints (and thus external users) to create a "standing query" and be notified when a matching metacard is created, updated, or deleted.

Notably, the Catalog allows event evaluation on both the previous value (if available) and new value of a Metacard when an update occurs.

Eventing allows ${branding}s to receive events on operations (e.g. create, update, delete) based on particular queries or actions.
Once subscribed, users will receive notifications of events such as update or create on any source.

=== Eventing Components

The key components of ${branding} Eventing include:

* Subscription
* Delivery Method
* <<_event_processor,Event Processor>>

After reading this section, you will be able to:

* Create new subscriptions
* Register subscriptions
