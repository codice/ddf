==== Subscriptions

Subscriptions represent "standing queries" in the Catalog.
Like a query, subscriptions are based on the OGC Filter specification.

===== Subscription Lifecycle

A Subscription itself is a series of events during which various plugins or transformers can be called to process the subscription.

====== Creation

* Subscriptions are created directly with the <<_event_processor,Event Processor>> or declaratively through use of the Whiteboard Design Pattern.
* The Event Processor will invoke each Pre-Subscription Plugin and, if the subscription is not rejected, the subscription will be activated.

====== Evaluation

* When a metacard matching the subscription is created, updated, or deleted in any Source, each Pre-Delivery Plugin will be invoked.

* If the delivery is not rejected, the associated Delivery Method callback will be invoked.

====== Update Evaluation

Notably, the Catalog allows event evaluation on both the previous value (if available) and new value of a Metacard when an update occurs.

====== Durability

Subscription durability is not provided by the Event Processor.
Thus, all subscriptions are transient and will not be recreated in the event of a system restart.
It is the responsibility of Endpoints using subscriptions to persist and re-establish the subscription on startup.
This decision was made for the sake of simplicity, flexibility, and the inability of the Event Processor to recreate a fully-configured Delivery Method without being overly restrictive.

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Subscriptions are not persisted by the Catalog itself.* +
Subscriptions must be explicitly persisted by an endpoint and are not persisted by the Catalog.
The Catalog Framework, or more specifically the Event Processor itself, does not persist subscriptions.
Certain endpoints, however, can persist the subscriptions on their own and recreate them on system startup.

==== Creating a Subscription

Currently, the Catalog reference implementation does not contain a subscription endpoint.
Therefore, an endpoint that exposes a web service interface to create, update, and delete subscriptions would provide a client's subscription filtering criteria to be used by Catalog's Event Processor to determine which events are of interest to the client.
The endpoint client also provides the callback URL of the event consumer to be called when an event matching the subscription's criteria is found.
This callback to the event consumer is made by a Delivery Method implementation that the client provides when the subscription is created. 
Whenever an event occurs in the Catalog matching the subscription, the Delivery Method implementation will be called by the Event Processor. 
The Delivery Method will, in turn, send the event notification out to the event consumer. 
As part of the subscription creation process, the Catalog verifies that the event consumer at the specified callback URL is available to receive callbacks.
Therefore, the client must ensure the event consumer is running prior to creating the subscription.
The Catalog completes the subscription creation by executing any pre-subscription Catalog Plugins, and then registering the subscription with the OSGi Service Registry.
The Catalog does not persist subscriptions by default.

===== Event Processing and Notification

If an event matches a subscription's criteria, any pre-delivery plugins that are installed are invoked, the subscription's `DeliveryMethod` is retrieved, and its operation corresponding to the type of ingest event is invoked. 
For example, the `DeliveryMethod` `created()` function is called when a metacard is created.
The `DeliveryMethod` operations subsequently invoke the corresponding operation in the client's event consumer service, which is specified by the callback URL provided when the `DeliveryMethod` was created.
An internal subscription tracker monitors the OSGi registry, looking for subscriptions to be added (or deleted).
When it detects a subscription being added, it informs the Event Processor, which sets up the subscription's filtering and is responsible for posting event notifications to the subscriber when events satisfying their criteria are met.

The Standard Event Processor is an implementation of the Event Processor and provides the ability to create/delete subscriptions.
Events are generated by the ${ddf-catalog}Framework as metacards are created/updated/deleted and the Standard Event Processor is called since it is also a Post-Ingest Plugin.
The Standard Event Processor checks each event against each subscription's criteria.

When an event matches a subscription's criteria the Standard Event Processor:

* invokes each pre-delivery plugin on the metacard in the event.
* invokes the `DeliveryMethod` operation corresponding to the type of event being processed, e.g., `created()` operation for the creation of a metacard.

====== Using ${branding} Implementation

If applicable, the implementation of `Subscription` that comes with ${branding} should be used.
It is available at `ddf.catalog.event.impl.SubscriptionImpl` and offers a constructor that takes in all of the necessary objects.
Specifically, all that is needed is a `Filter`, `DeliveryMethod`, `Set<String>` of source IDs, and a `boolean` for enterprise.

The following is an example code stub showing how to create a new instance of Subscription using the ${branding} implementation. 

.Creating a Subscription
[source,java,linenums]
----
// Create a new filter using an imported FilterBuilder
Filter filter = filterBuilder.attribute(Metacard.ANY_TEXT).like().text("*");
 
// Create a implementation of DeliveryMethod
DeliveryMethod deliveryMethod = new MyCustomDeliveryMethod();
 
// Create a set of source ids
// This set is empty as the subscription is not specific to any sources
Set<String> sourceIds = new HashSet<String>();
 
// Set the isEnterprise boolean value
// This subscription example should notifications from all sources (not just local)
boolean isEnterprise = true;

Subscription subscription = new SubscriptionImpl(filter, deliveryMethod, sourceIds,isEnterprise);
----

===== Delivery Method

A Delivery Method provides the operation (created, updated, deleted) for how an event's metacard can be delivered.

A Delivery Method is associated with a subscription and contains the callback URL of the event consumer to be notified of events.
The Delivery Method encapsulates the operations to be invoked by the Event Processor when an event matches the criteria for the subscription.
The Delivery Method's operations are responsible for invoking the corresponding operations on the event consumer associated with the callback URL.
