===== Using the Route Manager

The Route Manager gives an administrator the ability to configure and deploy routes, queues, and topics dynamically. If a need arises for a new route, an administrator can easily develop a new route and deploy it to satisfy the requirement, rather than spending the time to develop, compile, and test new code.

To deploy a new route, simply place a route `.XML` file in the `<KARAF_HOME>/routes` directory of ${branding}. To remove a route (or set of routes), delete the `.XML` file.

There are example routes in the `<KARAF_HOME>/routes` directory by default.
