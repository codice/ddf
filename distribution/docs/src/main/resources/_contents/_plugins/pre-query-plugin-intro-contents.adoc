==== Pre-Query Plugins

Pre-query plugins are invoked before a query operation is sent to any of the Sources. 
This is an opportunity to take any action on the query, including but not limited to:

* validation
* logging
* auditing
* optimization
* security filtering

=====  Pre-Query Plugins Failure Behavior

In the event that this Catalog Plugin cannot operate but does not wish to fail the transaction, a `PluginExecutionException` will be thrown.
For any other Exceptions, the Catalog will "fail safe" and the Operation will be cancelled.
If processing is to be explicitly stopped, a `StopProcessingException` will be thrown.

===== Invoking Pre-Query Plugins

Pre-query plugins are invoked serially, prioritized by descending OSGi service ranking. 
The plugin with the highest service ranking will be executed first. 
The output of a pre-query plugin is sent to the next pre-query plugin, until all have executed and the query operation is sent to the requested Source.
