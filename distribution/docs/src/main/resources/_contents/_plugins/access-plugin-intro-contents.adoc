==== Access Plugins

Access plugins are invoked directly after the <<_policy_plugin,Policy plugins>> have been successfully executed.Â  This is an opportunity to either stop processing or modify the request/response based on policy information.

===== Access Plugins Failure Behavior

All failure cases should be handled internally to the plugin with the exception of the `StopProcessingException`. If the exception encountered should stop/block the request then a `StopProcessingException` should be thrown.
