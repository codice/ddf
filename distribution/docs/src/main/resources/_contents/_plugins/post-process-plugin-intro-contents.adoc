=== Post-Process Plugins
[NOTE]
====
This code is experimental. While this interface is functional and tested, it may change or be removed in a future version of the library.
====
Post-process plugins are invoked after a metacard has been created, updated, or deleted and committed to the Catalog.
They are the last plugins to run and are triggered by a Post-Ingest Plugin.
