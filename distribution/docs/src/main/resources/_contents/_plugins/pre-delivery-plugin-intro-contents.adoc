==== Pre-Delivery Plugin

Pre-delivery plugins are invoked before a Delivery Method is invoked on a Subscription. 
This is an opportunity to take any action before notification, including but not limited to:

* logging
* auditing
* security filtering/redaction

===== Pre-Delivery Plugin Failure Behavior

In the event that this Catalog Plugin cannot operate but does not wish to fail the transaction, a `PluginExecutionException` will be thrown.
For any other Exceptions, the Catalog will "fail safe" and the Operation will be cancelled.
If processing is to be explicitly stopped, a `StopProcessingException` will be thrown.

===== Invoking Pre-Delivery Plugins

Pre-delivery plugins are invoked serially, prioritized by descending OSGi service ranking.
The plugin with the highest service ranking will be executed first. 

The output of a pre-delivery plugin is sent to the next pre-delivery plugin, until all have executed and the Delivery Method is invoked on the associated Subscription.
