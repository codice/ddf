Post-ingest plugins are invoked after data has been created, updated, or deleted in aÂ Catalog Provider.

====== Post-Ingest Plugin Failure Behavior

In the event that this Catalog Plugin cannot operate but does not wish to fail the transaction, a `PluginExecutionException` will be thrown.

====== Invoking a Post-Ingest Plugin

Because the event has already occurred and changes from one post-ingest plugin cannot affect others, all Post-Ingest plugins are invoked in parallel and no priority is enforced.
