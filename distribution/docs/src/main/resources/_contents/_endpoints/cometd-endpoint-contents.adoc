==== CometD Endpoint

The http://cometd.org[CometD] endpoint enables asychronous search capabilties.
The CometD protocol is used to execute searches, retrieve results, and receive notifications.

For an example of using CometD within a webapp see: `distribution/sdk/sample-cometd/`

===== Installing CometD Endpoint

The CometD Endpoint is installed by default with a standard installation in the ${app-name} application.

===== Configuring CometD Endpoint

None.

===== Using CometD Endpoint

.CometD Endpoint URL
----
${secure_url}/search/cometd
----

====== Query

Queries can be executed over CometD using the `/service/query` channel.
Query messages are json formatted and use cql alongside several other parameters.

.Query Parameters
[cols="1,3,1", options="header"]
|===
|Parameter Name
|Description
|Required

|`src`
|Catalog Source
|No

|`cql`
|CQL query
|Yes

|`sort`
|Sort Type
|No

|`id`
|Query ID (Should be a uuid), This determines the channel that the query results will be returned on.
|Yes
|===

Before a query is published the client should subscribe to the channel that will be passed in to the `id` field in order to receive query results once the query is executed.

For example if the following id was generated `3b19bc9c-2155-4ca6-bae8-65a9c8e373f6`, the client should subscribe to `/3b19bc9c-2155-4ca6-bae8-65a9c8e373f6`

Then the following example query could be executed:

.`/service/query`
[source,json]
----
{
  "cql":"(\"anyText\" ILIKE 'foo')",
  "id":"3b19bc9c-2155-4ca6-bae8-65a9c8e373f6"
}
----

This would return any results matching the text `foo` on the `/3b19bc9c-2155-4ca6-bae8-65a9c8e373f6` channel


====== CometD Notifications

Notifications are messages that are sent to clients to inform them of some significant event happening.
Clients must subscribe to a notification channel to receive these messages.

Notifications are published by the server on several notification channels depending on the type.

* subscribing to ``/${ddf-branding-lowercase}/notifications/**`` will cause the client to receive all notifications.
* subscribing to `/${ddf-branding-lowercase}/notifications/catalog/downloads` will cause the client to only receive notifications of downloads.

====== Using CometD Notifications

[NOTE]
====
The ${branding} Search UI serves as a reference implementation of how clients can use notifications.
====

Notifications are currently being utilized in the Catalog application for resource retrieval.
When a user initiates a resource retrieval, the channel `/ddf/notification/catalog/downloads` is opened, where notifications indicating the progress of that resource download are sent.
Any client interested in receiving these progress notifications must subscribe to that channel.
${branding} starts downloading the resource to the client that requested it, a notification with a status of "Started" will be broadcast.
If the resource download fails, a notification with a status of "Failed" will be broadcast.
Or, if the resource download is being attempted again after a failure, "Retry" will be broadcast.
When a notification is received, ${branding} Search UI displays a popup containing the contents of the notification, so a user is made aware of how their downloads are proceeding.
Behind the scenes, the ${branding} Search UI invokes the REST endpoint to retrieve a resource.
In this request, it adds the query parameter "user" with the CometD session ID or the unique User ID as the value.
This allows the CometD server to know which subscriber is interested in the notification.
For example, `http://${branding}_HOST:8181/services/catalog/sources/${branding-lowercase}.
distribution/2f5db9e5131444279a1293c541c106cd?
transform=resource&user=1w1qlo79j6tscii19jszwp9s2i55` notifications contain the following information:

|===

====== Receive Notifications

* If interested in retrieve resource notifications, a client must subscribe to the CometD channel `/ddf/notification/catalog/downloads`.
* If interested in all notification types, a client must subscribe to the CometD channel `/ddf/notification/\*\*`
* A client will only receive notifications for resources they have requested.
* Standard UI is subscribed to all notifications of interest to that user/browser session: `/ddf/notification/\*\*`
* See the Usage section for the data that a notification contains.

====== Notification Events

Notifications are messages that are sent to clients to inform them of some significant event
happening. Clients must subscribe to a notification channel to receive these messages.

====== Notifications Channel

To receive all notifications, subscribe to ``/ddf/notifications/**``

====== Notification Message Format

Notifications follow a specific format when they are published to the notifications channel.
This message contains a data map that encapsulates the notification information.

====== Persistence of Notifications

Notifications are persisted between sessions, however due to the nature of CometD communications, they will not be visible at first connection/subscription to ``/${ddf-branding-lowercase}/notifications/**``.

In order to retrieve notifications that were persisted or may have occurred since the previous session a client simply must publish an empty json message, `{}` to `/${ddf-branding-lowercase}/notifications`.
This will return all existing notifications to the user.

====== Activity Events Channel

To receive all activity updates, follow the instructions at <<asynchronous_search_subscribing, Subscribing to Notifications>> and subscribe to `/ddf/activities/\*\*`

Activity update messages follow a specific format when they are published to the activities channel.
These messages contain a data map that encapsulates the activity information.

===== Developing CometD Clients for Asynchronous Search and Retrieval
${ddf-branding} uses the http://cometd.org/[CometD] framework to perform asynchronous operations on the catalog.
This is most apparent in the UI application, which is able to perform multiple queries and display them asynchronously as the results are returned.
CometD has a http://docs.cometd.org/2/reference/[comprehensive manual] that details how to interact with and best use the framework with a variety of clients (e.g., javascript, java, perl, and python).

The <<_search_ui,Search UI>> code can be used as reference implementation of how a JavaScript client can be created to integrate with the CometD endpoint.
Examples are included below for convenience.

===== General Operations

====== Initialization

CometD offers both Dojo and jQuery bindings that allow CometD to be easily used with those frameworks.
For more information on the individual bindings, refer to the http://docs.cometd.org/2/reference/javascript.html[JavaScript Library page] in the CometD reference manual.
The UI application uses the jQuery library.
To initialize the CometD connection, an instance of CometD must be created and configured to point to the server and call the handshake, which creates the network connection.
The CometD endpoint is exposed at `/search/cometd`, and it is recommended to not use websockets when connecting.

.Example Initialization with JQuery
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
// create a reference to the standard cometd object
Cometd.Comet = $.cometd;

// disable websocket protocol
Cometd.Comet.websocketEnabled = false;

// configure the location of the cometd endpoint on the server
Cometd.Comet.configure({
	url: 'http://server:8181/search/cometd'
});

// create network connection to server
Cometd.Comet.handshake({});
----

===== Subscribe

A client can asynchronously receive information from the server using subscriptions.
Once the client subscribes to a particular topic, it is sent information when the server sends a response on that topic.
Subscriptions are performed in the UI to retrieve information for notifications, tasks, and query results.

.Example Subscription
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
// subscribe to a topic, calling the function whenever a new message comes in
var subscription = Cometd.Comet.subscribe("/ddf/notifications/**",
function(resp) { ... } );

// unsubscribe from a topic
Cometd.Comet.unsubscribe(subscription);
----

[NOTE]
====
Further documentation is available from http://docs.cometd.org/2/reference/javascript_subscribe.html[CometD].
====

===== Publish

Publishing allows clients to send information to the server.
This allows the clients to perform queries on the server and perform operations on tasks, such as canceling a download.

.Example Publish
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
// perform a query on the server where data contains the search criteria
Cometd.Comet.publish('/service/query', { data: { ... } });
----

===== Publish Notifications

Any application running in ${branding} can publish notifications that can be viewed by the Search UI or received by another notifications client.

. Set a properties map containing entries for each of the parameters listed above in the Usage section.
. Set the OSGi event topic to `ddf/notification/<application-name>/<notification-type>` Notice that there is no preceding slash on an OSGi event topic name, while there is one on the CometD channel name. The OSGi event topic corresponds to the CometD channel this is published on.
. Post the notification to the OSGi event defined in the previous step.

.Example for Publishing Notification
[source,java,linenums]
----
Dictionary <String, Object> properties = new Hashtable<String,
Object>();
properties.put("application", "Downloads");
properties.put("title", resourceResponse.getResource().getName());
Long sysTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();
properties.put("message", generateMessage(status,
resourceResponse.getResource().getName(), bytes, sysTimeMillis,
detail));
properties.put("user", getProperty(resourceResponse, USER));
properties.put("status", "Completed");
properties.put("bytes", 1024);
properties.put("timestamp", sysTimeMillis);
Event event = new Event("ddf/notification/catalog/downloads",
properties);
eventAdmin.postEvent(event);
----

[NOTE]
====
Futher documentation is available at http://docs.cometd.org/2/reference/javascript_publish.html[CometD].
====

===== Retrieving Persisted Notifications and Activities

To retrieve persisted notifications or activities, publish an empty message on the corresponding base channel.
This will trigger a response to an awaiting Cometd subscription.
Refer to <<Developing CometD Clients for Asynchronous Search and Retrieval>> for instructions on how to publish to a CometD channel.

.Example: Persistence Retrieval
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
Cometd.Comet.publish("/ddf/notifications", {});
Cometd.Comet.publish("/ddf/activities", {});
----

.Asynchronous Query
[NOTE]
====
