Endpoints act as a proxy between the client and the <<_catalog_framework, Catalog Framework.>>

Endpoints expose the Catalog Framework to clients using protocols and formats that the clients understand.

Endpoint interface formats/protocols can include a variety of formats, including (but not limited to):

* SOAP Web services
* RESTful services
* JMS
* JSON
* OpenSearch

The endpoint may transform a client request into a compatible Catalog format and then transform the response into a compatible client format.
Endpoints may use Transformers to perform these transformations.
This allows an endpoint to interact with Source(s) that have different interfaces.
For example, an OpenSearch Endpoint can send a query to the Catalog Framework, which could then query a federated source that has no OpenSearch interface.

Endpoints are meant to be the only client-accessible components in the Catalog.
