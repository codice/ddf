This quick tutorial will enable install, configuring and using a basic instance of ${branding}.

These steps will demonstrate:

- [*] Prerequisites
- [*] Installation
- [*] Ingesting into the ${ddf-branding} Catalog

==== Prerequisites

* Install/Upgrade to Java 8 http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[J2SE 8 SDK]
** The recommended version is http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8u60-relnotes-2620227.html[8u60] or later.
** Java Version and Build numbers must contain only number values.
* Supported platforms are *NIX - Unix/Linux/OSX, Solaris, and Windows.
* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[JDK8] must be installed.
* The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set to the location where the JDK is installed.
** Replace `<JAVA_VERSION>` with the version and build number installed.

.Setting `JAVA_HOME` on *NIX
----
JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/<JAVA_VERSION>
export JAVA_HOME
----

.Setting `JAVA_HOME` on Windows
----
set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\<JAVA_VERSION> /m
----

.Adding `JAVA_HOME` to `PATH` Environment Variable on Windows
----
setx PATH "%PATH%;%JAVA_HOME%\bin" /m
----

.*NIX
[WARNING]
====
Unlink `/usr/bin/java` if it is already linked to a previous version of the JRE:
`unlink /usr/bin/java`
====

.Verify that the `JAVA_HOME` was set correctly.
[TIP]
====

.*NIX
----
echo $JAVA_HOME
----

.Windows
----
echo %JAVA_HOME%
----
====

* ${branding} installation zip file.
* A web browser.
* For Linux systems, increase the file descriptor limit by editing `/etc/sysctl.conf` to include or change the following:

.File Descriptor Limit on Linux
[NOTE]
====
* For Linux systems, increase the file descriptor limit by editing `/etc/sysctl.conf` to include:

----
fs.file-max = 6815744
----

* For the change to take effect, a restart is required.

. *Nix Restart Command
----
init 6

==== Installing ${branding}

. Download the ${branding} {download-url}[zip file].
. Install ${branding} by unzipping the zip file.
. This will create an installation directory, which is typically created with the name and version of the application.
This installation directory will be referred to as `<INSTALL_DIR>`.
(Substitute the actual directory name.)
. Start ${branding} by running the `<INSTALL_DIR>/bin/${branding-lowercase}` script (or `${branding-lowercase}.bat` on Windows).
. The ${command-console} will display.

.${command-console} Prompt
----
${branding-lowercase}${at-symbol}local>
----

==== Configuring

. In a browser, navigate to the ${admin-console} at ${secure_url}/admin.
.. The ${admin-console} may take a few minutes to start up.
. Enter the default username of `admin` and the password of `admin`.
. Follow the installer prompts for a standard installation.
.. Click *Start* to begin the setup process.
.. Configure <<_guest_interceptor,guest claims attributes>> or use defaults.
... (these attributes represent the minimum authorization for all users)
.. Select *Standard Installation*.
.. On the System Configuration page, configure any port or protocol changes desired and add any keystores/truststores needed.
... See <<_configuring_new_certificates,Configuring New Certificates>> for more details.
.. Click *Next*
.. Click *Finish*

==== Ingesting Quickstart

Now that ${branding} has been configured, ingest some sample data to demonstrate search capabilities.

This is one way to ingest into the catalog, for a complete list of the different methods, see <<_ingesting_data,Ingesting Data>>.

===== Ingesting Sample Data

. Download a sample valid https://codice.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1179756/geojson_valid.json?version=1&modificationDate=1368249436010&api=v2[GeoJson file here].
. Navigate in the browser to the Search UI at ${secure_url}/search.
. Click the *upload* image:upload_icon.png[upload, title="upload"] icon in the upper right corner.
. Select the file to upload.

[NOTE]
====
XML metadata for text searching is not automatically generated from GeoJson fields.
====

Querying from the Search UI (${secure_url}/search) will return the record for the file ingested:

* Enter `*` in the Text search box and click the *Search* button.

[NOTE]
====
The sample data was selected as an example of well-formed metadata.
Other data can and should be used to test other usage scenarios.
