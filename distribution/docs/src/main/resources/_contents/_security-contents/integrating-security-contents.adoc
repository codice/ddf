=== Installing the Embedded LDAP Server

The embedded OpenDJ LDAP server can be installed for testing purposes.

==== Run the Embedded LDAP Instance

. Unzip and install ${branding}
. Run the installer at https://localhost:8993/admin
. After the install is complete, click the *Manage* button in the upper right hand corner
. Click the *Play* icon on the Opendj Embedded application tile
. The embedded LDAP is now installed.

==== Configuration
The configuration options are located on the ${admin-console} under *Opendj Embedded -> Configuration -> LDAP Server*. It currently contains three configuration options.

The configuration options are located on the standard ${branding} configuration ${admin-console} under the title *LDAP Server*.
It currently contains three configuration options.

[cols="1,7" options="header"]
|===

|Configuration Name
|Description

|LDAP Port
|Sets the port for LDAP (plaintext and startTLS). 0 will disable the port.

|LDAPS Port
|Sets the port for LDAPS. 0 will disable the port.

|Base LDIF File
|Location on the server for a LDIF file.
This file will be loaded into the LDAP and overwrite any existing entries.
This option should be used when updating the default groups/users with a new LDIF file for testing.
The LDIF file being loaded may contain any LDAP entries (schemas, users, groups, etc.).
If the location is left blank, the default base LDIF file will be used that comes with ${branding}.

|===

==== Trust Certificates

For LDAPS or startTLS to function correctly, it is important that the LDAP server is configured with a keystore file that trusts the clients it is connecting to and vice versa.
Complete the following procedure to provide your own keystore information for the LDAP. 

. The embedded LDAP server is not recommended for production use as it has hardcoded keystores and truststores with localhost certificates. These cannot be changed unless the embedded server bundle is re-built with new stores.

==== Connect to a Standalone LDAP Server

${branding} instances can connect to an external LDAP server by installing and configuring the `security-sts-ldaplogin` and `security-sts-ldapclaimshandler` features detailed here.

==== Embedded LDAP Configuration

The Embedded LDAP application contains an LDAP server (OpenDJ version 2.6.2) that has a default set of schemas and users loaded to help facilitate authentication and authorization testing.

==== Configuration

===== Start and Stop

The embedded LDAP application installs a feature with the name `ldap-embedded`.
Installing and uninstalling this feature will start and stop the embedded LDAP server.
This will also install a fresh instance of the server each time.
If changes need to persist, stop then start the `embedded-ldap-opendj` bundle (rather than installing/uninstalling the feature).

All settings, configurations, and changes made to the embedded LDAP instances are persisted across ${branding} restarts.
If ${branding} is stopped while the LDAP feature is installed and started, it will automatically restart with the saved settings on the next ${branding} start.

===== Settings

The configuration options are located on the standard ${branding} configuration ${admin-console} under the title LDAP Server.
It currently contains three configuration options.

[cols="2,6" options="header"]
|===

|Configuration Name
|Description

|LDAP Port
|Sets the port for LDAP (`plaintext` and `StartTLS`). 0 will disable the port.

|LDAPS Port
|Sets the port for LDAPS. 0 will disable the port.

|Base LDIF File
|Location on the server for a LDIF file. This file will be loaded into the LDAP and overwrite any existing entries. This option should be used when updating the default groups/users with a new ldif file for testing. The LDIF file being loaded may contain any ldap entries (schemas, users, groups..etc). If the location is left blank, the default base LDIF file will be used that comes with ${branding}.

|===

==== Limitations

Current limitations for the embedded LDAP instances include:

* Inability to store the LDAP files/storage outside of the ${branding} installation directory. This results in any LDAP data (i.e., LDAP user information) being lost when the `ldap-embedded` feature is uninstalled.
* Cannot be run standalone from ${branding}. In order to run `embedded-ldap`, the ${branding} must be started.

==== LDAP Administration

OpenDJ provides a number of tools for LDAP administration. Refer to the http://opendj.forgerock.org/opendj-server/doc/admin-guide/[OpenDJ Admin Guide].

===== Download the Admin Tools

Download http://www.forgerock.org/opendj-archive.html[OpenDJ (Version 2.4.6)] and the included tool suite.

===== Use the Admin Tools

The admin tools are located in `<opendj-installation>/bat` for Windows and `<opendj-installation>/bin` for `*nix`. 
These tools can be used to administer both local and remote LDAP servers by setting the *host* and *port* parameters appropriately.

==== External/WS-S STS Support

===== Security STS WSS

This configuration works just like the STS Client Config for the internal STS, but produces standard requests instead of the custom ${branding} ones.
It supports two new auth types for the context policy manager, WSSBASIC and WSSPKI.

===== Security STS Address Provider

This allows one to select which STS address will be used (e.g. in SOAP sources) for clients of this service.
Default is off (internal).

==== Security STS LDAP Claims Handler

The ${ddf-security} STS LDAP Claims Handler bundle adds functionality to the STS server that allows it to retrieve claims from an LDAP server.
It also adds mappings for the LDAP attributes to the STS SAML claims.

[NOTE]
====
All claims handlers are queried for user attributes regardless of realm.
This means that two different users with the same username in different LDAP servers will end up with both of their claims in each of their individual assertions.

=== Security STS Service

The ${ddf-security} STS Service performs authentication of a user by delegating the authentication request to an STS. This is different than the services located within the Security PDP application as those ones only perform authorization and not authentication.

==== Security STS Server

The ${ddf-security} STS Server is a bundle that starts up an implementation of the CXF STS.
The STS obtains many of its configurations (Claims Handlers, Token Validators, etc.) from the OSGi service registry as those items are registered as services using the CXF interfaces.
The various services that the STS Server imports are listed in the Implementation Details section of this page.

[NOTE]
====
The WSDL for the STS is located at the `security-sts-server/src/main/resources/META-INF/sts/wsdl/ws-trust-1.4-service.wsdl` within the source code.

=== Security PDP

The ${ddf-security} Policy Decision Point (PDP) module contains services that are able to perform authorization decisions based on configurations and policies.
In the ${ddf-security} Framework, these components are called realms, and they implement the `org.apache.shiro.realm.Realm` and `org.apache.shiro.authz.Authorizer` interfaces.
Although these components perform decisions on access control, enforcement of this decision is performed by components within the notional PEP application.

=== Security PDP AuthZ Realm

The ${ddf-security} PDP AuthZ Realm exposes a realm service that makes decisions on authorization requests using the attributes stored within the metacard to determine if access should be granted.
This realm can use XACML and will delegate decisions to an external processing engine if internal processing fails.
Decisions are first made based on the "match-all" and "match-one" logic.
Any attributes listed in the "match-all" or "match-one" sections will not be passed to the XACML processing engine and they will be matched internally.
It is recommended to list as many attributes as possible in these sections to avoid going out to the XACML processing engine for performance reasons.
If it is desired that all decisions be passed to the XACML processing engine, remove all of the "match-all" and "match-one" configurations.
The configuration below provides the mapping between user attributes and the attributes being asserted - one map exists for each type of mapping (each map may contain multiple values).

Match-All Mapping:: This mapping is used to guarantee that all values present in the specified metacard attribute exist in the corresponding user attribute.
Match-One Mapping:: This mapping is used to guarantee that at least one of the values present in the specified metacard attribute exists in the corresponding user attribute.

* Match-One Mapping:  This mapping is used to guarantee that at least one of the values present in the specified metacard attribute exists in the corresponding user attribute.

This bundle is not installed by default but can be added by installing the `security-pdp-java` feature.

This bundle is installed by default and can be added by installing the `security-pdp-authz` feature if it was uninstalled previously.

==== Configuring

Settings can be found in the ${admin-console} (https://localhost:8993/admin) under *${ddf-security} -> Configuration -> Security AuthZ Realm*.

|Match-All Mappings
| 
|These map user attributes to metacard security attributes to be used in "Match All" checking. All the values in the metacard attribute must be present in the user attributes in order to "pass" and allow access. These attribute names are case-sensitive.

|Match-One Mappings
|
|These map user attributes to metacard security attributes to be used in "Match One" checking. At least one of the values from the metacard attribute must be present in the corresponding user attribute to "pass" and allow access. These attribute names are case-sensitive.

==== Guest Interceptor

The goal of the `GuestInterceptor` is to allow non-secure clients (SOAP requests without security headers) to access secure service endpoints. 

All requests to secure endpoints must include, as part of the incoming message, a user's credentials in the form of a SAML assertion or a reference to a SAML assertion.
For REST/HTTP requests, either the assertion itself or the session reference (that contains the assertion) is included.
For SOAP requests, the assertion is included in the SOAP header. 

Rather than reject requests without user credentials, the guest interceptor detects the missing credentials and inserts an assertion that represents the "guest" user.
The attributes included in this guest user assertion are configured by the administrator to represent any unknown user on the current network.

===== Installing Guest Interceptor

The `GuestInterceptor` is installed by default with ${ddf-security} Application.

===== Configuring Guest Interceptor

==== Configuring via the ${admin-console}

. Navigate to the ${admin-console} at https://localhost:8993/admin
. Click the ${ddf-security} application tile
. Click the *Configuration* tab
. Click the *Security STS Guest Claims Handler* configuration
. Click the + next to Attributes to add a new attribute
. Add any addtional attributes that you want every user to have
. Click *Save changes*

Once these configurations have been added, the GuestInterceptor is ready for use.
Both secure and non-secure requests will be accepted by all secure ${branding} service endpoints.

=== Security IdP

The Security IdP application provides service provider handling that satisfies the http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-profiles-2.0-os.pdf[SAML 2.0 Web SSO profile] in order to support external IdPs (Identity Providers).
