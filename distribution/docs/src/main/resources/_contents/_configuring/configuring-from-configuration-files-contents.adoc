As most configurations are stored in configuration files, in some instances it may make sense to edit those configuration files directly.
Additionally, configuration files may be pre-created and copied into a ${branding} installation.
Finally, in an environment hardened for security purposes, access to the ${admin-console} or the ${command-console} might be denied and using the latter in such an environment may cause configuration errors.
It is necessary to configure ${branding} (e.g., providers, Schematron rulesets, etc.) using `.config` files.

==== Configuring Global Settings

Global configuration settings are configured via the properties file `system.properties`.
These properties can be manually set by editing this file or set via the initial configuration from the ${admin-console}.

[NOTE]
====
Any changes made to this file require a restart of the system to take effect.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
The passwords configured in this section reflect the passwords used to decrypt JKS (Java KeyStore) files.
Changing these values without also changing the passwords of the JKS causes undesirable behavior.

|===

These properties are available to be used as variable parameters in input url fields within the ${admin-console}.
For example, the url for the local csw service (\${secure_url}/services/csw) could be defined as:

[source]
----
${variable-prefix}org.codice.ddf.system.protocol}${variable-prefix}org.codice.ddf.system.hostname}:${variable-prefix}org.codice.ddf.system.port}${variable-prefix}org.codice.ddf.system.rootContext}/csw
----

This variable version is more verbose, but will not need to be changed if the system `host`, `port` or `root` context changes.

[WARNING]
====
Only root can access ports < 1024 on Unix systems.
====

==== Configuring with .config Files

The ${branding} is configured using `.config` files.
Like the Karaf `.cfg` files, these configuration files must be located in the `<${ddf-branding}_HOME>/etc/` directory, have a name that matches the _configuration persistence ID_ (PID) they represent, and have a `service.pid` property set to the configuration PID.

As opposed to `.cfg` however, this type of configuration file supports lists within configuration values (metatype `cardinality` attribute greater than 1).

[IMPORTANT]
====
This new configuration file format *must* be used for any configuration that makes use of lists.
Examples include Web Context Policy Manager (PID: `org.codice.ddf.security.policy.context.impl.PolicyManager`)
and Security STS Guest Claims Handler (PID: `ddf.security.sts.guestclaims`).
====

[WARNING]
====
Only one configuration file should exist for any given PID.
The result of having both a `.cfg` and a `.config` file for the same PID is undefined and could cause the application to fail.
====

The main purpose of the configuration files is to allow administrators to pre-configure ${branding} without having to use the ${admin-console}.
In order to do so, the configuration files need to be copied to the `<${branding}_HOME>/etc` directory after ${branding} zip has been extracted.

Upon start up, all the `.config` files located in `<${branding}_HOME>/etc` are automatically read and processed.
Files that have been processed successfully are moved to `<${branding}_HOME>/etc/processed` so they will not be processed again when the system is restarted.
Files that could not be processed are moved to the `<${branding}_HOME>/etc/failed` directory.

${branding} also monitors the `<${branding}_HOME>/etc` directory for any new `.config` file that gets added.
As soon as a new file is detected, it is read, processed and moved to the appropriate directory based on whether it was successfully processed or not.

==== Configuring Managed Service Factory Bundles

Services that are created using a Managed Service Factory can be configured using `.config` files as well.
The configuration files follow a different naming convention however.
The files must start with the Managed Service Factory PID, be followed by a unique identifier and have a `.config` extension.
For instance, assuming that the Managed Service Factory PID is `org.codice.ddf.factory.pid` and two instances of the service need to be configured, files `org.codice.ddf.factory.pid.<UNIQUE ID 1>.config` and `org.codice.ddf.factory.pid.<UNIQUE ID 2>.config` should be created and added to `<${branding}_HOME>/etc`.

The unique identifiers used in the file names have no impact on the order in which the configuration files are processed.
No specific processing order should be assumed.
Also, a new service will be created and configured every time a configuration file matching the Managed Service Factory PID is added to the directory, regardless of the _unique id_ used.

These configuration files must also contain a `service.factoryPid` property set to the factory PID (without the sequential number).
They should not however contain the `service.pid` property.

===== File Format

The basic syntax of the `.config` configuration files is similar to the older `.cfg` files but introduces support for lists and types other than simple strings.
The type associated with a property must match the `type` attribute used in the corresponding `metatype.xml` file when applicable.

The following table shows the format to use for each property type supported.

[cols="1,2,4" options="header"]

* Lists of values can be prefixed with any of the supported types (`B`, `I`, `L`, `F` or `D`)
* To prevent any configuration issues, the `=` signs used in values should be escaped using a backslash (`\`)
* Boolean values will default to `false` if any value other than `true` is provided
* Escape character in values must be used for double quotes (`"`) and spaces, but cannot be used with `{` `}` or `[` `]` pairings

==== Configuring Files in HOME Directory Hierarchy

Many important configuration settings are stored in the `<${branding}_HOME>` directory.


[NOTE]
====
Depending on the environment, it may be easier for integrators and administrators to configure ${branding} using the ${admin-console} prior to disabling it for hardening purposes.
The ${admin-console} can be re-enabled for additional configuration changes.
====

In an environment hardened for security purposes, access to the ${admin-console} or the ${command-console} might be denied and using the latter in such an environment may cause configuration errors.
It is necessary to configure ${branding} (e.g., providers, Schematron rulesets, etc.) using `.config` files.

A template file is provided for some configurable ${branding} items so that they can be copied/renamed then modified with the appropriate settings.

[WARNING]
====
If the ${admin-console} is enabled again, all of the configuration done via `.config` files will be loaded and displayed.
However, note that the name of the `.config` file is not used in the ${admin-console}.
Rather, a universally unique identifier (UUID) is added when the ${branding} item was created and displays this UUID in the console (e.g., `OpenSearchSource.112f298e-26a5-4094-befc-79728f216b9b`)
====

==== Configuring Using a .config File Template


A template file is provided for some configurable ${branding} items so that they can be copied/renamed then modified with the appropriate settings.

The following steps define the procedure for configuring a new source or feature using a `config` file:

. Copy/rename the provided template file in the ``etc/templates` directory to the `etc` directory. (Refer to the table above to determine correct template.)
.. Not required, but a good practice is to change the instance name (e.g., `OpenSearchSource.1.config`) of the file to something identifiable (`OpenSearchSource.remote-site-1.config`).
. Edit the copied file to etc with the settings for the configuration. (Refer to the table above to determine the configurable properties).
.. Consult the inline comments in the file for guidance on what to modify.

The new service can now be used as if it was created using the ${admin-console}.

==== Configuring Solr Provider Data Directory

The Solr Provider and the Embedded Solr Provider writes index files to the file system.
By default, these files are stored under `${branding}_HOME/data/solr/catalog/data`.
If there is inadequate space in `${branding}_HOME`, or if it is desired to maintain backups of the indexes only, this directory can be changed.

In order to change the Data Directory, the `system.properties` file in `${branding}_HOME/etc` must be edited prior to starting ${branding}.

.Edit the `system.properties` file
[source]
----
# Uncomment the following line and set it to the desired path
# solr.data.dir = ${karaf.home}/data/solr
----

===== Changing the Data Directory

It may become necessary to change the data directory after ${branding} has ingested data.

. Shut down the ${branding}.
. Create the new directory to hold the indexes.
+
.Make new Data Directory
[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p /path/to/new/data/dir
----
+
. Copy the indexes to the new directory.
+
.Copy the indexes to the new Directory.
[source,bash]
----
cp /path/to/old/data/dir/* /path/to/new/data/dir/.
----
+
. Set the `system.properties` file to use the new directory.
+
.Update system.properties file
[source,java]
----
solr.data.dir = /path/to/new/data/dir
----
+
. Restart the ${branding}.

==== Configuring Thread Pools

The `org.codice.ddf.system.threadPoolSize` property can be used to specify the size of thread pools used by:

* Federating requests between ${branding} systems
* Downloading resources
* Handling asynchronous queries, such as queries from the UI

By default, this value is set to 128.
It is not recommended to set this value extremely high.
If unsure, leave this setting at its default value of 128.


==== Configuring ${branding} Web Service Providers

By default Solr, STS server, STS client and the rest of the services use the system property `org.codice.ddf.system.hostname` which is defaulted to 'localhost' and not to the fully qualified domain name of the ${branding} instance.
Assuming the ${branding} instance is providing these services, the configuration must be updated to use the *fully qualified domain name* as the service provider.

This can be changed during <<Initial Configuration>> or later by editing the `<INSTALL_HOME>/etc/system.properties` file. See <<Editing ${branding} Web Service Providers Configuration Files>>.
