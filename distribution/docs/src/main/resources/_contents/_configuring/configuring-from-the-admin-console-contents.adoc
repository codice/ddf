. Click *Start* to begin.
. On the next screen, set any attributes for Guest users on the system. These are the default attributes assigned to all users of the system. See <<_guest_attributes,Guest Attributes>> for more information.

|===

|Features
|The features tab breaks down the individual features of the application that can be installed or uninstalled as configurable features.

|===

==== Managing Applications

The *Manage* button enables activation/deactivation and adding/removing applications.

===== Activating / Deactivating Applications

The *Deactivate* button stops individual applications and any dependent apps.
Certain applications are central to overall functionality and cannot be deactivated.
These will have the *Deactivate* button disabled.
Disabled apps will be moved to a list at the bottom of the page, with an enable button to reactivate, if desired.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Deactivating ${ddf-admin}, ${ddf-platform}, and ${ddf-security} will cause errors within the system, so the capabilities to do so have been DISABLED.
====

===== Adding Applications

The *Add Application* button is at the end of the list of currently active applications.

===== Removing Applications

To remove an application, it must first be deactivated.
This enables the *Remove Application* button.

===== Upgrading Applications

Each application tile includes an *Upgrade* button to select a new version to install.

==== System Settings Tab

The configuration and features installed can be viewed and edited from the System tab as well, however, it is recommended that configuration be managed from the applications tab.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In general, applications should be managed via the applications tab.
Configuration via this page could result in an unstable system.
Proceed with caution!
====

==== Configuring HTTP Port from ${admin-console}

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not use the ${admin-console} to change the HTTP port.
While the ${admin-console}'s Pax Web Runtime offers this configuration option, it has proven to be unreliable and may crash the system.
Use the <<_configuring_the_http_port_from_the_command_console, ${command-console}>> instead.
====

===== Configuring HTTP to HTTPS Proxy From the ${admin-console}

The `platform-http-proxy` feature proxies https to http for clients that cannot use HTTPS and should not have HTTP enabled for the entire container via the `etc/org.ops4j.pax.web.cfg` file.

. Click the *${ddf-platform}* application tile.
. Choose the *Features* tab.
. Select `platform-http-proxy`.
. Click on the *Play* button to the right of the word “Uninstalled”

====== Configuring the proxy:

[NOTE]
====
The hostname should be set by default.
Only configure the proxy if this is not working.
====

. Select *Configuration* tab.
. Select *HTTP to HTTPS Proxy Settings*
.. Enter the Hostname to use for HTTPS connection in the proxy.
. Click *Save changes*.

==== Configuring the Product Cache

All caching properties are part of the <<ddf.catalog.resource.download.ReliableResourceDownloadManager,Resource Download Settings>>.

===== Invalidating the Product Cache

. The product cache directory can be administratively invalidated by turning off the product caching using the Enable Product Caching configuration.
. Alternatively, an administrator may manually invalidate products by removing them from the file system. Products are cached at the directory specified in the Product Cache Directory configuration.

Format:

`<INSTALL-DIR>/data/product-cache/<source-id>-<metacard-id>`

Example:

`<INSTALL-DIR>/data/product-cache/abc123`
