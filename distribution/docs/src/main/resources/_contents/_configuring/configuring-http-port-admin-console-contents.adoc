==== Configuring HTTP Port from ${admin-console}

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not use the ${admin-console} to change the HTTP port.
While the ${admin-console}'s Pax Web Runtime offers this configuration option, it has proven to be unreliable and may crash the system.
Use the <<_configuring_from_the_command_console, ${command-console}>> instead.
