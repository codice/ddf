==== Configuring Global Settings with system.properties

Global configuration settings are configured via the properties file `system.properties`.
These properties can be manually set by editing this file or set via the initial configuration from the ${admin-console}.

[NOTE]
====
Any changes made to this file require a restart of the system to take effect.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
The passwords configured in this section reflect the passwords used to decrypt JKS (Java KeyStore) files.
Changing these values without also changing the passwords of the JKS causes undesirable behavior.

${variable-prefix}org.codice.ddf.system.protocol}${variable-prefix}org.codice.ddf.system.hostname}:${variable-prefix}org.codice.ddf.system.port}${variable-prefix}org.codice.ddf.system.rootContext}/csw
