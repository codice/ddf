As most configurations are stored in configuration files, in some instances it may make sense to edit those configuration files directly.
Additionally, configuration files may be pre-created and copied into a ${branding} installation.
Finally, in an environment hardened for security purposes, access to the ${admin-console} or the ${command-console} might be denied and using the latter in such an environment may cause configuration errors.
It is necessary to configure ${branding} (e.g., providers, Schematron rulesets, etc.) using `.config` files.
