The Configuration Export/Import capability allows administrators to export the current ${branding} configuration and use it to restore the same state on a brand new installation or when adding a second node to an highly available deployment.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Importing configuration files is only guaranteed to work when importing files from the same ${branding} version.
  Importing from a different version is not supported.
* To keep the export/import process simple and consistent, all system configuration files are required to be under the `<${branding}_HOME>` directory.
