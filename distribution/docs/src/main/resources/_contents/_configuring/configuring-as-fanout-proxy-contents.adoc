==== Configuring ${branding} as a Fanout Proxy

This scenario describes how to configure ${branding} as a fanout proxy such that only queries and resource retrieval requests are processed and create/update/delete requests are rejected.
Additionally, all queries are enterprise queries and no catalog provider needs to be configured.

. Start ${branding} following the Starting and Stopping instructions.
. Reconfigure ${branding} in fanout proxy mode by going to the Features tab in the ${admin-console}.
The Standard Catalog Framework (`catalog-core-standardframework` feature) has a property (`fanout`) that needs to be enabled.

${branding} is now operating as a fanout proxy.
Only queries and resource retrieval requests will be allowed.
All queries will be federated.
Create, update, and delete requests will throw an `UnsupportedOperationException`, even if a Catalog Provider was configured prior to the reconfiguration to fanout.
