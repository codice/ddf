The Configuration Export/Import capability allows administrators to export the current ${branding} configuration and use it as a starting point for a new installation.
This is useful when upgrading or expanding use of ${branding} where an identical configuration of multiple instances is desired.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Importing configuration files is only guaranteed to work when importing files from the same ${branding} version.
  Importing from a different version is not recommended as it may cause the new ${branding} instance to be incorrectly configured and become unusable.
* All configurations will be exported to` <${branding}_HOME>/etc/exported` followed by their relative path from `<${branding}_HOME>`. For instance, `<${branding}_HOME>/etc/keystores/keystore.jks` will be exported to `<${branding}HOME>/etc/exported/etc/keystores/keystore.jks`, while `<${branding}_HOME>/etc/system.properties` will be exported to `<${branding}_HOME>/etc/exported/etc/system.properties`.
* To keep the export/import process simple and consistent, all system configuration files are required to be under the `${branding}_HOME` directory.

==== Exporting Existing Configurations from ${admin-console}

You can export the current system configurations using the ${admin-console}.
This is useful for migrating from one running instance to another.

To export the current system configurations, follow these instructions:

. Select the *System* tab (next to the *Applications* tab)
+
image::exporting_configuration_step1.png[]
. Click the *Export Configuration* button
+
image::exporting_configuration_step2.png[]
. Fill out the form, specifying the _destination_ for the export. A relative path will be relative to `<${branding}_HOME>`.
+

. Click the *Start Export* button.
. If there are no warnings or errors, the form will automatically close upon finishing the export

==== Export Existing Configuration Settings from ${command-console}

To export the current ${branding} configuration from the ${command-console}:

. Type in `migration:export <directory>`. This command creates the exported configuration files that are saved to the specified directory. If no directory is specified it will default to `<${branding}_HOME>/etc/exported`
. Zip up the exported files in the export directory.
----
cd  <${branding}_HOME>/etc/exported
zip -r exportedFiles.zip *
----

==== Troubleshooting Common Warnings or Failures

If export is unsuccessful, use this list to verify the correct configuration.

* Export Destination Directory Permissions Set to Read Only.

* Properties Set to Absolute File Paths
** Setting properties to absolute paths is not allowed; so update the property to a value that is relative to `<${branding}_HOME>`.
However, notice that the export did not completely fail, but issued a warning that a specific file was excluded.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Some system configuration files contain paths to other configuration files. For instance, the `system.properties` file contains the `javax.net.ssl.keyStore` property which provides the path to system key store.
The files referred to in the system configuration files will be included in the export process only if the path is relative to `${branding}_HOME`.
Using absolute paths and/or symbolic links in those cases will cause the `migration:export` command to display warnings about those files and exclude them from the export process.
The export process itself will not be aborted.

==== Importing the Exported Configuration Settings

[WARNING]
====
Importing of configurations must take place before starting the new installation for the first time.
====

To import a previously exported configuration:

. Delete all exising `.config` files from `<${branding}_HOME>/etc`:
.. `cd <${branding}_HOME>`
.. `rm etc/*.config`
.. `unzip /path/to/exported/zip/exportFiles.zip`
. Unzip the exported files from a previous installation to the new instance's `<${branding}_HOME>/etc` directory: `unzip exportedFiles.zip <${branding}_HOME>/etc`
. If needed, manually update system configuration files such as `system.properties`, `users.properties`. keystores, etc.
. Launch the newly installed ${branding}.
. Step through the installation process. The newly installed ${branding} will have the previous ${branding}'s settings imported.
. To get a status of the import, run the `migration:status` from the Command Line Console.
