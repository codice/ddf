==== ${admin-console} Modules

The ${admin-console} is a modular system that can be expanded with additional modules as necessary.
${ddf-admin} comes with the Configuration module and the Installer modules.
However, new modules can be added, and each module is presented in its own tab of the ${admin-console}.

Admin Modules are single components that implement the `org.codice.ddf.ui.admin.api.module.AdminModule` interface.
Once they implement and expose themselves as a service, they are added to the ${admin-console} as a new tab.
