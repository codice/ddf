=== ${ddf-branding} and OSGi

The ${ddf-branding} follows the OSGi set of commercial standards and best practices, governed by a broad-reaching industry alliance, for developing and deploying modular Java code.

. OSGi bundles tend to be small, cohesive and de-coupled, significantly reducing development and debug time.
. With the appropriate organizational incentives in place to encourage re-use over code creation, further, significant efficiencies are realized by re-use of OSGi Bundles and Services.
Current industry trends are collectively shifting away from rigidly coupled, static, opaque environments towards adaptive, loosely coupled systems which are dynamically assembled from well-defined software components that run across a fluid set of computer resources.
. OSGi is the industry standard for Java modularity.
