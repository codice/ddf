=== Compression Services

The compression services offer CXF-based message encoding that allows for compression of outgoing and incoming messages.

==== Install and Uninstall

The compression services are not installed by default within the platform application. Installing them can be done by doing:

[source]
----
feature:install compression-[DESIRED COMPRESSION SERVICE]
----

Where [DESIRED COMPRESSION SERVICE] is one of the following:

[cols="2,6" options="header"]
|===

|Compression Type
|Description

|`exi`
|Adds Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) support to outgoing responses. EXI is an W3C standard for XML encoding that shrinks xml to a smaller size than normal GZip compression. More information is available at http://www.w3.org/XML/EXI/[EXI].

|`gzip`
|Adds GZip compression to in and outgoing messages through CXF components. Code comes with CXF.

|===

[WARNING]
====
Due to the way CXF features work, the compression services either need to be installed BEFORE the desired CXF service is started or the CXF service needs to be refreshed / restarted after the compression service is installed.
