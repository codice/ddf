The ${ddf-admin} Application contains components that are responsible for the installation and configuration ${branding} applications.

It contains various services and interfaces that allow administrators more control over their systems and enhances administrative capabilities when installing and managing ${branding}.

The Admin application contains an application service that handles all operations that are performed on applications.
This includes adding, removing, starting, stopping, and showing status.

=== Installing ${ddf-admin}

The ${ddf-admin} application is installed by default with a standard installation.

=== Configuring ${ddf-admin}

==== Defining Platform Settings

The platform settings can be configured by the `<INSTALL_HOME>/etc/system.properties` file.

The settings in this file can be changed at any time during the ${branding} lifecycle (before installation, after, or during run-time) and will take effect after a system restart.

=== Console Commands

The application service comes with various console commands that can be executed on the ${command-console}.

==== Application Service Interfaces

The Application service has multiple ways of interacting with it.
These methods include operations that can be performed by integrators, administrators, and end users.

==== Installing and Uninstalling

The Admin App installs this service by default.
It is recommended to NOT uninstall the application service unless absolutely necessary.

==== Configuring

None.

=== Administrative User Interface

The ${admin-console} is the centralized location for administering the system.
The ${admin-console} allows an administrator to install and remove selected applications and their dependencies and access configuration pages to configure and tailor system services and properties.
The default address for the ${admin-console} is \https://localhost:8993/admin.

==== Modules

The ${admin-console} is a modular system that can be expanded with additional modules as necessary.
${branding} comes with the Configurations module and the Installation modules.
However, new modules can be added, and each module is presented in its own tab of the ${admin-console}.

Modules are single components that implement the `org.codice.ddf.ui.admin.api.module.AdminModule` interface.
Once they implement and expose themselves as a service, they are added in to the ${admin-console} as a new tab.

==== Included Modules

* Installer Module
* Configuration Module

===== Installer Module

The application installer module enables a user to install and remove applications.
Each application includes a features file that provides a description of the application and a list of the dependencies required to successfully run that application.
The installer reads the features file and presents the applications in a manner that allows the administrator to visualize these dependencies.
As applications are selected or deselected, the corresponding dependent applications are selected or deselected as necessary.

====== Set Up the Installer Module

. Install the module if it is not already pre-installed. +
`feature:install admin-modules-installer`

. Open a web browser and navigate to the Installation page. +
`http://DDF_HOST:DDF_PORT/admin`
- Adding the `?dev=true` query string will auto generate the certificates +
`http://DDF_HOST:DDF_PORT/admin/index.html?dev=true`

. Log in with the default username of "admin" (no quotes) and the default password of "admin" (no quotes).

. Select the Setup tab if not already selected.

====== Example Screenshots

The following are examples of what the Installation Steps/Pages look like:

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do NOT deselect/uninstall the Platform App or the Admin App.
Doing so will disable the use of this installer and the ability to install/uninstall other applications.
====

* Installation Profile Page
** When a profile is selected, it will auto select applications on the Select Application Page and install them automatically.

** If choose to customize a profile, you will be given the options to manually selected the applications on the Select Application Page.

* In the Select applications to install page, hover over each application to view additional details about the application.

* New applications can be added and existing applications can be upgraded using the Applications Module.

* When an application is selected, dependent applications will automatically be selected.

* When an application is unselected, dependent applications will automatically be unselected.

==== Custom Installation

image::application_details.png[Application Details]

* If apps are preselected when the Select applications to install page is reached, they will be uninstalled if unselected.

* Applications can also be installed using kar deployment as stated inÂ Application Installation.

[WARNING]
====
Platform App, Admin App, and Security Services App CANNOT be selected or unselected as it is installed by default and can cause errors if removed.

Security Services App appears to be unselected upon first view of the tree structure, but it is in fact automatically installed with a later part of the installation process.

==== Configuration Module

The configuration module allows administrators to change bundle and service configurations.

===== Set Up the Module

. Install the module if it is not pre-installed.
`feature:install admin-modules-configuration`

. Open a web browser and navigate to the ${admin-console} page.

`http://DDF_HOST:DDF_PORT/admin`

. Select the Configurations tab if not already selected.

===== Configurations Tab

=== ${admin-console} Access Control

If you have integrated ${branding} with your existing security infrastructure, then you may want to limit access to parts of the ${branding} based on user roles/groups.

==== Restricting ${branding} Access

. See the documentation for your specific security infrastructure to configure users, roles, and groups.

. On the `/system/console/configMgr`, select the Web Context Policy Manager.
(IMG)

.. A dialogue will pop up that allows you to edit ${branding} access restrictions.

.. Once you have configured your realms in your security infrastructure, you can associate them with ${branding} contexts.

.. If your infrastructure supports multiple authentication methods, they may be specified on a per-context basis.

.. Role requirements may be enforced by configuring the required attributes for a given context.

.. The whitelist allows child contexts to be excluded from the authentication constraints of their parents.

==== LDAP Admin Role Configuration

The admin role will default to `system-admin`. This can be configured to work with an external LDAP with a few minor changes.

==== Update the admin role in `INSTALL_HOME/etc/users.properties`

Change the value of 'system-admin' to the new admin role for any users needing the new role.

.Example `user.properties` entries:
[source]
----
admin=admin,group,admin,manager,viewer,webconsole,system-admin
localhost=localhost,group,admin,manager,viewer,webconsole,system-admin
----

[NOTE]
====
A system restart is required for the changes to `users.properties` to take effect.
====

==== Update the web context policy to point to the new admin role

. Open ${ddf-security} in the ${admin-console}
. Select the Configuration tab and open Web Context Policy Manager
. Update the entries under 'Required Attributes' to set the new admin role
