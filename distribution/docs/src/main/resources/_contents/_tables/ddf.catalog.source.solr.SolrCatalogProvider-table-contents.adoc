|Data Directory File Path
|dataDirectoryPath
|String
|Specifies the directory to use for data storage. A shutdown of the server is necessary for this property to take effect. If a filepath is provided with directories that don't exist, Solr Catalog Provider (SCP) will attempt to create those directories. Out of the box (without configuration), this Solr Catalog Provider writes to <DISTRIBUTION_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY>/data/solr. It is recommended to use an absolute filepath to minimize confusion such as /opt/solr_data in Linux or C:/solr_data in Windows.
