=== Resource Writers

A resource writer stores a resource and produces a URI that can be used to retrieve the resource at a later time.
The resource URI uniquely locates and identifies the resource.
Resource writers can interact with an underlying data store and store the resource in the proper place.
Each implementation can do this differently, providing flexibility in the data stores used to persist the resources.

.Included Resource Writers
The Catalog reference implementation currently does not include any resource writersÂ out of the box.
