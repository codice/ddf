Transformers transform data to and from various formats.
Transformers can be categorized on the basis of when they are invoked and used.
The existing types are Input transformers, Metacard transformers, and Query Response transformers.
Additionally, XSLT transformers are provided to aid in developing custom, lightweight Metacard and Query Response transformers.

Transformers are utility objects used to transform a set of standard ${branding} components into a desired format, such as into PDF, GeoJSON, XML, or any other format.
For instance, a transformer can be used to convert a set of query results into an easy-to-read GeoJSON format (GeoJSON Transformer) or convert a set of results into a RSS feed that can be easily published to a URL for RSS feed subscription.
A major benefit of transformers is that they can be registered in the OSGi Service Registry so that any other developer can access them based on their standard interface and self-assigned identifier, referred to as its "shortname."
Transformers are often used by endpoints for data conversion in a system standard way.
Multiple endpoints can use the same transformer, a different transformer, or their own published transformer.

[WARNING]
====
The current transformers only work for UTF-8 characters and do not support Non-Western Characters (e.g., Hebrew).
It is recommend not to use international character sets as they may not be displayed properly.

Transformers are used to alter the format of a resource or its metadata to or from the catalogâ€™s metacard format.

.Types of Transformers
<<input_transformers,Input Transformers>>:: Input Transformers create metacards from input. An input transformer transforms raw data (text/binary) into a Metacard. Once converted to a Metacard, the data can be used in a variety of ways, such as in an `UpdateRequest`, `CreateResponse`, or within Catalog Endpoints or Sources. For instance, an input transformer could be used to receive and translate XML into a Metacard so that it can be placed within a `CreateRequest` in order to be ingested within the Catalog. Input transformers should be registered within the Service Registry with the interface `${ddf-branding}.catalog.transform.InputTransformer` in order to notify some Catalog components of any new transformers.

<<metacard_transformers,Metacard Transformers>>:: Metacard Transformers translate a metacard from catalog metadata to a specific data format.

<<query_response_transformers,Query Response Transformers>>:: Query Response transformers convert query responses into other data formats.
