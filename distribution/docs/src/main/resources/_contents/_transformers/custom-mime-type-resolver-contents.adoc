==== Custom Mime Type Resolver

The Custom Mime Type Resolver is a `MimeTypeResolver` that defines the custom mime types that ${branding} will support.
These are mime types not supported by the default `TikaMimeTypeResolver`.

|nitf
|image/nitf

|ntf
|image/nitf

|json
|json=application/json;id=geojson

|===

New custom mime type resolver mappings can be added using the ${admin-console}.

As a `MimeTypeResolver`, the Custom Mime Type Resolver will provide methods to map the file extension to the corresponding mime type, and vice versa.

===== Installing the Custom Mime Type Resolver

One Custom Mime Type Resolver is configured and installed for the `image/nitf` mime type.
This custom resolver is bundled in the `mime-core-app` application and is part of the `mime-core` feature.

Additional Custom Mime Type Resolvers can be added for other custom mime types.

====== Configuring the Custom Mime Type Resolver

The configurable properties for the Custom Mime Type Resolver are accessed from the *MIME Custom Types* configuration in the ${admin-console}.

* Navigate to the ${admin-console}.
* Select the *${ddf-platform}* application.
* Select *Configuration*.
* Select *MIME Custom Types*.
