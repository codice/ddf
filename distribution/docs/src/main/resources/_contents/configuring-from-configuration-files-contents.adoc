These properties are available to be used as variable parameters in input url fields within the ${admin-console}.
For example, the url for the local csw service (\${secure_url}/services/csw) could be defined as:

[source]
----
${variable-prefix}org.codice.${ddf-branding-lowercase}.system.protocol}${variable-prefix}org.codice.${ddf-branding-lowercase}.system.hostname}:${variable-prefix}org.codice.${ddf-branding-lowercase}.system.port}${variable-prefix}org.codice.${ddf-branding-lowercase}.system.rootContext}/csw
----

This variable version is more verbose, but will not need to be changed if the system `host`, `port` or `root` context changes.


[IMPORTANT]
====
Since certain bundles can only be configured using the `.config` file format, this file format should be used.
====

[WARNING]
====
Only root can access ports < 1024 on Unix systems.
For suggested ways to run ${branding} with ports < 1024 see <<How do I use port 80 as a non-root user?>>.
====

===== Configuring ${branding} `.config` Files

The ${branding} is configured using `.config` files.
Like the Karaf `.cfg` files, these configuration files must be located in the `<${ddf-branding}_HOME>/etc/` directory, have a name that matches the _configuration persistence ID_ (PID) they represent, and have a `service.pid` property set to the configuration PID.

As opposed to `.cfg` however, this type of configuration file supports lists within configuration values (metatype `cardinality` attribute greater than 1).

[IMPORTANT]
====
This new configuration file format *must* be used for any configuration that makes use of lists.
Examples include Web Context Policy Manager (PID: `org.codice.${ddf-branding-lowercase}.security.policy.context.impl.PolicyManager`)
and Security STS Guest Claims Handler (PID: `${ddf-branding-lowercase}.security.sts.guestclaims`).
====

[WARNING]
====
Only one configuration file should exist for any given PID.
The result of having both a `.cfg` and a `.config` file for the same PID is undefined and could cause the application to fail.
====

The main purpose of the configuration files is to allow administrators to pre-configure ${branding} without having to use the ${admin-console}.
In order to do so, the configuration files need to be copied to the `<${branding}_HOME>/etc` directory after ${branding} zip has been extracted.

Upon start up, all the `.config` files located in `<${branding}_HOME>/etc` are automatically read and processed.
Files that have been processed successfully are moved to `<${branding}_HOME>/etc/processed` so they will not be processed again when the system is restarted.
Files that could not be processed are moved to the `<${branding}_HOME>/etc/failed` directory.

${branding} also monitors the `<${branding}_HOME>/etc` directory for any new `.config` file that gets added.
As soon as a new file is detected, it is read, processed and moved to the appropriate directory based on whether it was successfully processed or not.

===== Configuring Managed Service Factory Bundles

Services that are created using a Managed Service Factory can be configured using `.config` files as well.
The configuration files follow a different naming convention however.
The files must start with the Managed Service Factory PID, be followed by a unique identifier and have a `.config` extension.
For instance, assuming that the Managed Service Factory PID is `org.codice.${ddf-branding-lowercase}.factory.pid` and two instances of the service need to be configured, files `org.codice.${ddf-branding-lowercase}.factory.pid.uniqueID1.config` and `org.codice.${ddf-branding-lowercase}.factory.pid.uniqueID2.config` should be created and added to `<${branding}_HOME>/etc`.

The unique identifiers used in the file names have no impact on the order in which the configuration files are processed.
No specific processing order should be assumed.
Also, a new service will be created and configured every time a configuration file matching the Managed Service Factory PID is added to the directory, regardless of the number used.

These configuration files must also contain a `service.factoryPid` property set to the factory PID (without the sequential number).
They should not however contain the `service.pid` property.

====== File Format

The basic syntax of the `.config` configuration files is similar to the older `.cfg` files but introduces support for lists and types other than simple strings.
The type associated with a property must match the `type` attribute used in the corresponding `metatype.xml` file when applicable.

The following table shows the format to use for each property type supported.

[cols="1,2,4" options="header"]
|===

|Type
|Format
|Example

|Service PID
|`service.pid = "servicePid"`
|`service.pid = "org.codice.${ddf-branding-lowercase}.security.policy.context.impl.PolicyManager"`

|Factory PID
|`service.factoryPid = "serviceFactoryPid"`
|`service.factoryPid = "Csw_Federated_Source"`

|Strings
|`name = "value"`
|`name = "john"`

|Booleans
|`name = B"true\|false"`
|`authorized = B"true"`

|Integers
|`name = I"value"`
|`timeout=I"60"`

|Longs
|`name = L"value"`
|`diameter = L"10000"`

|Floats
|`name = F"value"`
|`cost = F"10.50"`

|Doubles
|`name = D"value"`
|`latitude = D"45.0234"`

|Lists of Strings
|`name = [ "value1", "value2", ... ]`
|`complexStringArray = [ "{\"url\"\ \"http://test.sample.com\"\ \"layers\"\ [\"0\"]\ {\"VERSION\"\ \"1.1\|1.2\"\ \"image/png\"}\ \"beta\"\ 1}", "{\"url\"\ \"http://test.sample.com"\ 0.5}", "/solr\=SAML\|PKI\|basic", "/security-config\=SAML\|basic" ]`

|Lists of Integers
|`name = I[ "value1", "value1", ... ]`
|`sizes = I[ "10", "20", "30" ]`

|===

[NOTE]
====
* Lists of values can be prefixed with any of the supported types (`B`, `I`, `L`, `F` or `D`)
* To prevent any configuration issues, the `=` signs used in values should be escaped using `\`
* Boolean values will default to `false` if any value other than `true` is provided
* Escape character in values must be used for double quotes (`"`) and spaces, but cannot be used with `{` `}` or `[` `]` pairings

===== Editing ${branding} Web Service Providers Configuration Files

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the hostname is changed during the install to something other than `localhost` a new keystore and truststore must be provided.
====

[TIP]
====
When changing the hostname for testing or development purposes, the installer can be started with a `?dev=true` URL query parameter. This will cause the system to automatically generate self signed certificates for any hostname that is entered during the install process.
====

===== Configuring Files in HOME Directory Hierarchy

[IMPORTANT]
====
The passwords configured in this section reflect the passwords used to decrypt JKS (Java KeyStore) files.
Changing these values without also changing the passwords of the JKS causes undesirable behavior.

===== Configuring Notifications

Notifications are messages that are sent to clients to inform them of some significant event happening in ${branding}.
Clients must subscribe to a ${branding} notification channel to receive these messages.

===== Using Notifications

${branding} notifications are currently being utilized in the ${ddf-branding} Catalog application for resource retrieval.
When a user initiates a resource retrieval via the ${ddf-branding} Standard Search UI, ${branding} opens the channel `/${ddf-branding-lowercase}/notification/catalog/downloads`, where notifications indicating the progress of that resource download are sent.
Any client interested in receiving these progress notifications must subscribe to that channel.
When ${branding} starts downloading the resource to the client that requested it, a notification with a status of "Started" will be broadcast.
If the resource download fails, a notification with a status of "Failed" will be broadcast.
Or, if the resource download is being attempted again after a failure, "Retry" will be broadcast.

When a notification is received, ${ddf-branding} Standard UI displays a popup containing the contents of the notification, so a user is made aware of how their downloads are proceeding.

Behind the scenes, the ${ddf-branding} Standard Search UI invokes the REST endpoint to retrieve a resource.
In this request, it adds the query parameter "user" with the CometD session ID or the unique User ID as the value.
This allows the CometD server to know which subscriber is interested in the notification.
For example, \http://${branding}_HOST:8993/services/catalog/sources/${ddf-branding-lowercase}.distribution/2f5db9e5131444279a1293c541c106cd?transform=resource&user=1w1qlo79j6tscii19jszwp9s2i55 notifications contain the following information:

[cols="1,4,1" options="header"]
|===

|Parameter Name
|Description
|Required by ${branding} Standard UI

|`application`
|"Downloads" for resource retrieval.
This is used as a "type" or category of messages.
|Yes

|`title`
|Resource/file name for resource retrieval.
|Yes

|`message`
|Human-readable message containing status and a more detailed message.
|Yes

|`timestamp`
|Timestamp in milliseconds of when event occurs.
|Yes

|`user`
|CometD Session ID or unique User ID.
|Yes

|`status`
|Status of event.
|No

|`option`
|Resource retrieval option.
|No

|`bytes`
|Number of bytes transmitted.
|No

|===

====== Receive Notifications

* If interested in retrieve resource notifications, a client must subscribe to the CometD `channel/${ddf-branding-lowercase}/notification/catalog/downloads`.
* If interested in all notification types, a client must subscribe to the CometD `channel/${ddf-branding-lowercase}/notification/**`
* A client will only receive notifications for resources they have requested.
* ${ddf-branding} Standard UI is subscribed to all notifications of interest to that `user/browser session: /${ddf-branding-lowercase}/notification/**`

====== Publish Notifications

Any application running in ${branding} can publish notifications that can be viewed by the ${ddf-branding} Standard UI or received by another notifications client.
. Set a properties map containing entries for each of the parameters listed above in the Usage section.
+
. Set the OSGi event topic to `${ddf-branding-lowercase}/notification/<application-name>/<notification-type>`.
Notice that there is no preceding slash on an OSGi event topic name, while there is one on the CometD channel name.
The OSGi event topic corresponds to the CometD channel this is published on.
+
. Post the notification to the OSGi event defined in the previous step.

.Example for Publishing Notification

===== Configuring Solr Provider Data Directory

The Solr Provider and the Embedded Solr Provider writes index files to the file system.
By default, these files are stored under `${branding}_HOME/data/solr/catalog/data`.
If there is inadequate space in `${branding}_HOME`, or if it is desired to maintain backups of the indexes only, this directory can be changed.

In order to change the Data Directory, the `system.properties` file in `${branding}_HOME/etc` must be edited prior to starting ${branding}.

.Edit the `system.properties` file
[source]
----
# Uncomment the following line and set it to the desired path
# solr.data.dir = ${karaf.home}/data/solr
----

===== Changing the Data Directory after ${branding} has ingested data

. Shut down ${branding}.
. Create the new directory to hold the indexes.
+
.Make new Data Directory
[source,bash]
----
mkdir /path/to/new/data/dir
----
+
. Copy the indexes to the new directory.
+
.Copy the indexes to the new Directory.
[source,bash]
----
cp /path/to/old/data/dir/* /path/to/new/data/dir/.
----
+
. Edit the `system.properties` file to use the new directory.
+
.Edit the solr.data.dir system property
[source]
----
solr.data.dir = /path/to/new/data/dir
----
+
. Restart ${branding}.

===== Configuring Thread Pools

The `system.properties` file found under `${branding}_HOME/etc` contains properties that will be made available through system properties at the beginning of Karaf's boot process. The `org.codice.${ddf-branding-lowercase}.system.threadPoolSize` property can be used to specify the size of thread pools used by:
* Federating requests between ${branding} systems
* Downloading resources
* Handling asynchronous queries, such as queries from the UI

By default, this value is set to 128.
It is not recommended to set this value extremely high.
If unsure, leave this setting at it's default value of 128.
