The Configuration Export/Import capability allows administrators to export the current ${branding} configuration and use it as a starting point for a new installation.


[IMPORTANT]
====
* Importing configuration files is only guaranteed to work when importing files from the same ${branding} version.
  Importing from a different version is not recommended as it may cause the new ${branding} instance to be incorrectly configured and become unusable.
* All configurations editable in the Admin Console will be exported to `<${branding}_HOME>/etc/exported/etc`.
* All other configuration files (system configurations) will be put under `etc/exported/<ID>` followed by their relative path from `${branding}_HOME`. 
  For instance, if a key store file was located under `<${branding}_HOME>/keystores/keystore.jks`, it will be exported to `<${branding}_HOME>/etc/exported/<ID>/keystore/keystore.jks`.
* To keep the export/import process simple and consistent, all system configuration files are required to be under the `${branding}_HOME` directory.

==== Exporting Configurations from ${admin-console}

You can export the current system configurations using the ${admin-console}.
This is useful for migrating from one running instance to another.

To do so, follow these instructions:

. Select the `System` tab (next to the Applications tab) image:exporting_configuration_step1.png[Exporting Step 1,${image.width}]
. Click the `Export Configuration` button image:exporting_configuration_step2.png[Exporting Step 2,${image.width}]
. Fill out the form, specifying the destination for the export.  A relative path will be relative to ${branding} home. image:exporting_configuration_step3.png[Exporting Step 3,${image.width}]
. Click the `Start Export` button
. If there are no warnings or errors, the form will automatically close upon finishing the export

==== Export Configuration Settings from ${command-console}

To export the current ${branding} configuration:

. Using the ${command-console}, type in `migration:export <directory>`. This command creates the exported configuration files that are saved to the specified directory. If no directory is specified it will default to `<${branding}_HOME>/etc/exported`
. Zip up the exported files in the export directory.

cd  <${branding}_HOME>/etc/exported
zip exportedFiles.zip *

===== Troubleshooting Common Warnings or Failures

====== Insufficient Write Permissions

In the following case, the directory the user tried to export to had permissions set to read only.

====== Properties Set to Absolute File Paths

In the following case, the user had a property set to an absolute file path.
This is not allowed, and can be fixed by updating the property to a value that is relative to ${branding} home.
However, notice that the export did not completely fail.
It is simply informing the user that they did not include a specific file.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Some system configuration files contain paths to other configuration files. For instance, the `system.properties` file contains the `javax.net.ssl.keyStore` property which provides the path to system key store.
The files referred to in the system configuration files will be included in the export process only if the path is relative to `${branding}_HOME`.
Using absolute paths and/or symbolic links in those cases will cause the `migration:export` command to display warnings about those files and exclude them from the export process.
The export process itself will not be aborted.

==== Import Configuration Settings

To import a previously exported configuration:

. Delete all exising `.config` files from `<${branding}_HOME>/etc`: `rm <${branding}_HOME>/etc/*.config`
. Unzip the exported files from a previous installation to the new instance's `<${branding}_HOME>/etc` directory: `unzip exportedFiles.zip <${branding}_HOME>/etc`
. If needed, manually update system configuration files such as `system.properties`, `users.properties`. keystores, etc.
. Launch the newly installed ${branding}.
. Step through the installation process. The newly installed ${branding} will have the previous ${branding}'s settings imported.
. To get a status of the import, run the `migration:status` from the Command Line Console.
