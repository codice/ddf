Set up a complete, secure instance of ${branding}.
For simplified steps used for a testing, development, or demonstration installation, see <<_${branding-lowercase}_quick_start,${branding} Quick Start>>.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Although ${branding} can be installed by any user, it is recommended for security reasons to have a non-`root` user execute the ${branding} installation.
====

=== Installation Prerequisites

These are the system/environment requirements to configure _prior_ to an installation.

==== Java Requirements

* Install/Upgrade to Java 8 http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[J2SE 8 SDK]
** The recommended version is http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8u60-relnotes-2620227.html[8u60] or later.
** Java version must contain only number values.
* Supported platforms are *NIX - Unix/Linux/OSX, Solaris, and Windows.
* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[JDK8] must be installed.
* The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set to the location where the JDK is installed.

.Setting JAVA_HOME variable (Replace `<JAVA_VERSION>` with the version and build number installed.)
====

. Determine Java Installation Directory (This varies between operating system versions).
+
.Find Java Path in *NIX
----
which java
----
+
.Find Java Path in Windows
The path to the JDK can vary between versions of Windows, so manually verify the path under `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk<M.m.p_build>\bin\java.exe`
+
. Copy path to Java installation. (example: `/usr/java/<JAVA_VERSION`)
. Set `JAVA_HOME` by replacing <PATH_TO_JAVA> with the copied path in this command:

.Setting `JAVA_HOME` on *NIX
----
JAVA_HOME=<PATH_TO_JAVA><JAVA_VERSION>
export JAVA_HOME
----

.Setting `JAVA_HOME` on Windows
----
set JAVA_HOME=<PATH_TO_JAVA><JAVA_VERSION>
----

.Adding `JAVA_HOME` to `PATH` Environment Variable on Windows
----
setx PATH "%PATH%;%JAVA_HOME%\bin" /m
----
====

.*NIX
[WARNING]
====
Unlink `JAVA_HOME` if it is already linked to a previous version of the JRE:

`unlink JAVA_HOME`
====

.Verify that the `JAVA_HOME` was set correctly.
[TIP]
====

.*NIX
----
echo $JAVA_HOME
----

.Windows
----
echo %JAVA_HOME%
----
====

.File Descriptor Limit on Linux
[NOTE]
====
* For Linux systems, increase the file descriptor limit by editing `/etc/sysctl.conf` to include:

----
fs.file-max = 6815744
----

* (This file may need permissions changed to allow write access).
* For the change to take effect, a restart is required.

. *Nix Restart Command
----
init 6

=== Installing With the ${branding} Distribution Zip

.Check System Time
[WARNING]
====
Prior to installing ${branding}, ensure the system time is accurate to prevent federation issues.
====

To install the ${branding} distribution zip, perform the following:

. Download the ${branding} {download-url}[zip file].
. After the prerequisites have been met, as a root user if for *NIX, change the current directory to the desired install location.
This will be referred to as `<INSTALL_DIRECTORY>`.
+
.Windows Pathname Warning
====
Do not use spaces in directory or file names of the `<INSTALL_DIRECTORY>` path.
====
+
.Use a Non-root User on *NIX
[NOTE]
====
It is recommended that the root user create a new install directory that can be owned by a non-root user (e.g., ${branding-lowercase}-user).
The non-root user (e.g., ${branding-lowercase}-user) can now be used for the remaining installation instructions.
====
+
.Example: Create a Directory and Switch User on *NIX
----
mkdir new_installation
chown ${branding-lowercase}-user:${branding-lowercase}-group new_installation

su - ${branding-lowercase}-user
----
+
.Example: Create a Directory on Windows (Switching user not required for Windows)
----
mkdir new_installation
----
+
. Change the current directory to the location of the zip file (${branding-lowercase}-${project.version}.zip).
+
.*NIX (Example assumes ${branding} has been downloaded to a CD/DVD)
----
cd /home/user/cdrom
----
+
.Windows (Example assumes ${branding} has been downloaded to the D drive)
----
cd D:\
----
. Copy ${branding-lowercase}-${project.version}.zip to <INSTALL_DIRECTORY>.
+
.*NIX
----
cp ${branding-lowercase}-${project.version}.zip <INSTALL_DIRECTORY>
----
+
.Windows
----
copy ${branding-lowercase}-${project.version}.zip <INSTALL_DIRECTORY>
----
+
. Change the current directory to the desired install location.
+
.*NIX or Windows
----
cd <INSTALL_DIRECTORY>
----
+
. The ${branding} zip is now located within the `<INSTALL_DIRECTORY>`. Unzip ${branding-lowercase}-${project.version}.zip.
+
.*NIX
----
unzip ${branding-lowercase}-${project.version}.zip
----
+
.Windows Zip Utility Warning
[WARNING]
====
The default Windows zip utility (such as double-clicking file) will not work to unzip the distribution, use Java or a third party utility instead.

.Use Java to Unzip in Windows(Replace `<JAVA_VERSION>` with Current Version)
----
"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk<JAVA_VERSION>\bin\jar.exe" xf ${branding-lowercase}-${project.version}.zip
----
====
+
. If the ${branding} Standalone Solr Server will be installed later, an additional configuration step is required for the ${branding}.
Add the following lines to the bottom of the `<INSTALL_DIRECTORY>/etc/org.ops4j.pax.web.cfg` file:
+
.Additional Configuration Step
----
# Jetty Configuration
`org.ops4j.pax.web.config.file=<KARAF_HOME>/etc/jetty.xml`
----

==== Deployment Guidelines

${branding} relies on the Directory Permissions of the host platform to protect the integrity of the ${branding} during operation.
System administrators MUST perform the following steps prior to deploying bundles added to the ${branding}.

Within the `<INSTALL_DIRECTORY>`, a directory is created named ${branding-lowercase}-${project.version}.
This directory will be referred in the documentation as `<${branding}_HOME>`.

. Check the available storage space on the system to ensure the deployment will not exceed the available space.
. Set maximum storage space on the `<${branding}_HOME>/deploy` and `<${branding}_HOME>/system` directories to restrict the amount of space used by deployments.
. Do not assume the deployment is from a trusted source; verify its origination.

==== Directory Permissions

Restrict access to sensitive files by ensuring that the only users with access privileges are administrators.

===== Directory Permissions on Windows

Set directory permissions to protect the ${branding} from unauthorized access.

. Right-click on the file or directory noted below then select *Full Control -> Administrators -> System*.
. Click *Properties -> Security -> Advanced* and select `Creator Owner` for `<${branding}_HOME>` (e.g., `C:\${branding-lowercase}`).
. Restrict access to sensitive files by ensuring that only *System* and *Administrators* have Full Control to the below files by right-clicking on the file or directory below then selecting *Properties -> Security -> Advanced*
. Delete any other groups or users listed with access to `<${branding}_HOME>/etc` and `<${branding}_HOME>/deploy`.

===== Directory Permissions on *NIX

Set directory permissions to protect the ${branding} from unauthorized access.

* Change ownership of ${branding}_HOME
** `chown -R ${branding-lowercase}-use <${branding}_HOME>`
* Change group ownership on sub-directories
** `chgrp -R ${branding}_GROUP <${branding}_HOME>/etc <${branding}_HOME>/data <${branding}_HOME>/deploy`
* Change group permissions
** `chmod -R g-w <${branding}_HOME>/etc <${branding}_HOME>/data <${branding}_HOME>/deploy`
* Remove permissions for other users
** `chmod -R o-rwx <${branding}_HOME>/etc <${branding}_HOME>/data <${branding}_HOME>/deploy`


[IMPORTANT]
====
The system administrator must restrict certain directories to ensure that the application (user) cannot access restricted directories on the system.
For example the `${branding-lowercase}-user` should only have read access to `<${branding}_HOME>`.
====

==== Initial Startup

Run the ${branding} using the appropriate script.

.*NIX
----
<${branding}_HOME/bin/${branding-lowercase}
----

.Windows
----
<${branding}_HOME>/bin/${branding-lowercase}.bat
----

The distribution takes a few moments to load depending on the hardware configuration.

[TIP]
====
To run ${branding} as a service, see <<_starting_${branding-lowercase}_as_a_service>>.
====

==== Verifying Startup

At this point, ${branding} should be configured and running with a Solr Catalog Provider.
New features (endpoints, services, and sites) can be added as needed.

Verification is achieved by checking that all of the ${branding} bundles are in an *Active* state (excluding fragment bundles which remain in a *Resolved* state).

[NOTE]
====
It may take a few moments for all bundles to start so it may be necessary to wait a few minutes before verifying installation.
====

Execute the following command to display the status of all the ${branding} bundles:

.View Status
----
${branding-lowercase}${at-symbol}local>list | grep -i ${branding-lowercase}

----

[WARNING]
====
Entries in the *Resolved* state are expected, they are OSGi bundle fragments.
Bundle fragments are distinguished from other bundles in the command line console list by a field named `Hosts`, followed by a bundle number.
Bundle fragments remain in the *Resolved* state and can never move to the *Active* state.
====

.Example: Bundle Fragment in the Command Line Console
----
96 | Resolved |  80 | 2.10.0.SNAPSHOT | DDF :: Platform :: PaxWeb :: Jetty Config, Hosts: 90
----

After successfully completing these steps, the ${branding} is ready to be configured.
