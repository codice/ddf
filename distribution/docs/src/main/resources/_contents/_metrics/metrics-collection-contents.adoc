==== Metrics Collection Application

The Metrics Collection Application is responsible for collection both Catalog and Source metrics.

Use Metrics Collection to collect historical metrics data, such as catalog query metrics, message latency, or individual sources' metrics type of data.

===== Installing Metrics Collection

The Metrics Collection application is installed by default with a standard installation.

The catalog level metrics are packaged as the `catalog-core-metricsplugin` feature, and the source-level metrics are packaged as the `catalog-core-sourcemetricsplugin` feature.
