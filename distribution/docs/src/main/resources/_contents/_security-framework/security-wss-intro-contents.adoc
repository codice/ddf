=== Web Service Security Architecture

The Web Service Security (WSS) functionality that comes with ${branding} is integrated throughout the system.
This is a central resource describing how all of the pieces work together and where they are located within the system.

${branding} comes with a *Security Framework* and *Security Services*.
The Security Framework is the set of APIs that define the integration with the ${branding} framework and the Security Services are the reference implementations of those APIs built for a realistic end-to-end use case.
