==== Security STS Client Config

The ${ddf-security} STS Client Config bundle keeps track and exposes configurations and settings for the CXF STS client.
This client can be used by other services to create their own STS client.
Once a service is registered as a watcher of the configuration, it will be updated whenever the settings change for the sts client.

===== Installing Security STS Client Config

This bundle is installed by default.

===== Configuring Security STS Client Config

* Navigate to the ${admin-console}.
