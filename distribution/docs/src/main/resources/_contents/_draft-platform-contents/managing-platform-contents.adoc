The ${ddf-platform} application is considered to be a core application of the distribution.
The Platform application provides the fundamental building blocks that the distribution needs to run.
These building blocks include subsets of:

* http://karaf.apache.org/[Karaf] 
* http://cxf.apache.org/CXF[CXF] 
* http://camel.apache.org/[Camel] 

A Command Scheduler is also included as part of the Platform application.
The Command Scheduler allows users to schedule Command Line Shell Commands to run at certain specified intervals for the convenience of a "platform independent" method of running certain commands, such as backing up data or logging settings.
