===== WFS URL

The WFS URL must match the endpoint for the service being used.
The type of service and version are added automatically, so they do not need to be included.
Some servers will throw an exception if they are included twice, so do not include those.

The syntax depends on the server.
However, in most cases, the syntax will be everything before the `?` character in the URL that corresponds to the `GetCapabilities` query.

.Example GeoServer 2.5 Syntax
----
http://www.example.org:8080/geoserver/ows?service=wfs&version=1.0.0&request=GetCapabilities
----

In this case, the WFS URL would be: `http://www.example.org:8080/geoserver/ows`

===== Known Issues with the WFS v1.0.0 Source

None.
