<TITLE>MARK IV CORRECTS AGREEMENT WITH BAIRD &lt;BATM&gt;</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 20 - </DATELINE>
                    <BODY>Mark IV Industries Inc &lt;IV&gt;, which
has said it may consider a bid to seek control of Baird Corp,
said Baird has not agreed to hold off on any defensive measures
without giving Mark IV at least 24 hours notice.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Mark IV corrected a statement it made yesterday in another SEC
filing in which it listed several agreements reached with
Baird, including that Baird would not take any anti-takeover
steps without providing at least 24 hours notice.
    Mark IV said it was later told by Baird that Baird had
given no such assurance.
